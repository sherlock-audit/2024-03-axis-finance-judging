# The information of lots with an id greater than 0 will be lost, potentially resulting in a loss of funds for the users.

## Summary
When users create an `auction`, a new `lot ID` is assigned to that `auction`, and all relevant information, including the deposited `funds`, is stored.
However, this information is being overwritten, resulting in a loss of data.
As a consequence, users are unable to `bid` on these `auctions`, and the `auction creators` can not retrieve their funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a new `auction` is created, the `lotCounter` serves as the `lot ID` for that `auction`, and it is incremented for subsequent `auctions`.
```solidity
abstract contract Auctioneer is WithModules, ReentrancyGuard {
    uint96 public lotCounter;
}
```
Currently, we store all information for the new `auction` in `lotRouting[0]` because we assign the `lotCounter` as the `lotId` afterward.
```solidity
function auction(
    RoutingParams calldata routing_,
    Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
    string calldata infoHash_
) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
    Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
    {
        lotId = lotCounter++;
    }
}
```
As you can see, the `lotId` is 0 when accessing the `lotRouting` variable.
Consequently, all `auction` information is stored in `lotRouting[0]`.

So there is no `auction` information for `auctions 1, 2, ...`.
As a result, no one can bid for these auctions and the `creators` for these `auctions` can not retrieve their original `funds`.
## Impact
Users `funds` are at risk.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before accessing the `lotRouting` variable, assign the current `lotCounter` to the `lotId`.
```solidity
function auction(
    RoutingParams calldata routing_,
    Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
    string calldata infoHash_
) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
+   lotId = lotCounter++; 
    Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
    {
-        lotId = lotCounter++;
    }
}
```
