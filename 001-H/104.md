# `RoutingParams` stored at wrong index breaks lot creation functionality

## Summary
`lotId` variable is not intialized with correct value, when used to get correct position in `lotRouting` mapping, which leads to storing `Routing` data it wrong location.


## Vulnerability Detail
When we create new lot, we store its `Routing` data in mapping `lotRouting` by index `lotId`
```solidity
moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol
    mapping(uint96 lotId => Routing) public lotRouting;
```
At the time we pick position for `Routing` data in the mapping `lotRouting`
```solidity
moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol
    function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
        // Check that the module for the auction type is valid
        // Validate routing parameters

        // Tokens must not be the zero address
        if (address(routing_.baseToken) == address(0) || address(routing_.quoteToken) == address(0))
        {
            revert InvalidParams();
        }

        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];//@audit lotId is always 0 at this line

```
`lotId` is initialized to its default value `0`
So every new auction `Routing` data will be stored at postion zero `lotRouting[0]`, rewriting what is already there,
and every time we try to get data for some new auction we get empty `Routing` struct, because we never writed anything there, we always write to `lotRouting[0]`.

Check out test case below, add it next to other tests in
`moonraker/test/AuctionHouse/auction.t.sol`
```solidity
    function test_twoAuctions() external whenAuctionTypeIsAtomic whenAtomicAuctionModuleIsInstalled {
        // Create the auction
        vm.startPrank(_SELLER);
        _lotId = _auctionHouse.auction(_routingParams, _auctionParams, _INFO_HASH);

        //let's create another one
        _lotId = _auctionHouse.auction(_routingParams, _auctionParams, _INFO_HASH);

        //Assert values
        Auctioneer.Routing memory routing = _getLotRouting(_lotId);
        assertFalse(
            fromVeecode(routing.auctionReference) == fromVeecode(wrapVeecode(_routingParams.auctionType, 1))
        );
        assertFalse(routing.seller == _SELLER, "seller mismatch");
        assertFalse(address(routing.baseToken) == address(_baseToken), "base token mismatch");
        assertFalse(address(routing.quoteToken) == address(_quoteToken), "quote token mismatch");
    }
```
## Impact
First lot `Routing` data is rewritten on new lot creation, since lot data is stored in wrong place we can not get it when we try to interact with particular lot.
Users cannot interact with new auction lot, because every action will lead to `_getModuleForId(uint96 lotId_)` which will revert
```solidity

    function _getModuleForId(uint96 lotId_) internal view returns (AuctionModule) {
        // Load module, will revert if not installed
        return AuctionModule(_getModuleIfInstalled(lotRouting[lotId_].auctionReference));
    }
```
because `lotRouting[lotId_] will` return `Routing` with initialized default values 
`lotRouting[lotId_].auctionReference` will return `0` 
and `_getModuleIfInstalled(0)` will revert.
If the auction lot is prefunded, seller will lose funds they provided on the lot creation.
If first auction with `lotId == 0` is not concluded then bidders also lose their bids, it going to be a mess.

## Recommendation
Initialize `lotId` before `outing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];`
```diff
moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol
    function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
        (...)
+       lotId = lotCounter++;
        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];

        bool requiresPrefunding;
        uint96 lotCapacity;
        {
            // Load auction type module, this checks that it is installed.
            // We load it here vs. later to avoid two checks.
            AuctionModule auctionModule =
                AuctionModule(_getLatestModuleIfActive(routing_.auctionType));

            // Confirm tokens are within the required decimal range
            uint8 baseTokenDecimals = routing_.baseToken.decimals();
            uint8 quoteTokenDecimals = routing_.quoteToken.decimals();

            if (
                auctionModule.TYPE() != Module.Type.Auction || baseTokenDecimals < 6
                    || baseTokenDecimals > 18 || quoteTokenDecimals < 6 || quoteTokenDecimals > 18
            ) revert InvalidParams();

            // Increment lot count and get ID
-           lotId = lotCounter++;

            (...)
