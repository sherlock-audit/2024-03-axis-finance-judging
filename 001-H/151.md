# Auctioneer#auction stores routing data incorrectly which leads to loss of funds for sellers and bidders

## Summary

The Auctioneer#auction function accepts routing data and stores it in the wrong storage slot, overwrites past data and results in loss of funds for all participants.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Auctioneer#auction function is for starting a new auction, and accepts parameters from a seller. The routing parameters are fetched and then stored in the contract, in the variable lotRouting[lotId], where lotId is the new lot or auction's Id. This is iterated in the contract in Auctioneer#L194 ([Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker\src\bases\Auctioneer.sol#L194-L194)). However, the storage pointer to the variable is initialized much earlier in Auctioneer#L174 ([Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker\src\bases\Auctioneer.sol#L174-L174)). 

This means that the routing parameters, including seller details and other inputted parameters are stored in lotRouting[0] at all times. 

## Impact

This results in a new auction always wiping out the routing data of the previous auction, and mismatch between the auction details stored in modules and the one stored in the Auctioneer/AuctionHouse contract. Therefore, funds are lost from all participants including the seller. Funds from older auctions get locked in the contract and can never be recovered.

        Auctioneer.Routing memory storageRouting2 = _getLotRouting(_lotId2);

        console.log("Expected seller 1 : ", seller1);
        console.log("Seller 1 in stored routing : ", storageRouting1.seller);
        console.log("Expected seller 2 : ", seller2);
        console.log("Seller 2 in stored routing : ", storageRouting2.seller);
    }
```

To test this, you can run `forge test --mt test_RoutingIncorectStorageSet -vv`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Iterate the lotCounter before the storage variable is initialized.
