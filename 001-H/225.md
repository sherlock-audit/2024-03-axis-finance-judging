# `Auctioneer.auction()` is incorrectly accesing the routing in storage.

## Summary
During a creation of the auction lot, routing information is stored in a mapping from `lotId` to `Routing` struct. The problem is that it's accessed and stored incorrectly leading to data loss and corruption.
## Vulnerability Detail
[Auctioneer.sol#L160-L174](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L160-L174)
```solidity
function auction(
    RoutingParams calldata routing_,
    Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
    string calldata infoHash_
) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
    // Check that the module for the auction type is valid
    // Validate routing parameters
    // Tokens must not be the zero address
    if (
        address(routing_.baseToken) == address(0) ||
        address(routing_.quoteToken) == address(0)
    ) {
        revert InvalidParams();
    }
    Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
```
As can be seen, at the time `lotRouting` is accessed, `lotId` is still 0, leading to every auction lot being stored at 0th index, overriding information about a previous auction lot.
## Impact
Every time a new auction lot is created, it override the previously created lot, leading to lost data and incorrect information being used in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To correctly store data, initialize `lotId` to `lotCounter` before accessing the storage.
