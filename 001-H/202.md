# Auction data from previous auctions may be overwritten when a new auction is created with `Auctioneer.auction()`

## Summary

Due to an issue inside the function `Auctioneer.auction()`, important auction data stored in the mapping `Auctioneer.lotRouting` may be overwritten and lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

Upon creating a new auction via `Auctioneer.auction()`, routing information is stored inside the state variable `lotRouting[lotId]` (see line 174 Auctioneer.sol), which is a mapping that points from a uint96 `lotId` to a Routing struct. The routing struct contains important information for an auction like the `seller` or the `funding` amount or the type of base and quote token.

The issue is that when `Auctioneer.auction()` is called, `lotId` will always be 0 on line 174 in Auctioneer.sol. This means that after the auction is created with lotId 0, as soon as another auction is created by calling `Auctioneer.auction()`, the previously created auction will have its Routing information overwritten, since the data is always written into `lotRouting[0]` at line 174 in Auctioneer.sol since `lotId` is always 0.

## Impact

Starting from the 2nd auction that is created via `Auctioneer.auction()`, and ongoing for all future auctions that are created, Routing data from all previous auctions will be overwritten and unusable. 

For example important auction data like `Routing.seller`, `Routing.funding`, `Routing.baseToken`, `Routing.quoteToken` is overwritten for all previous auctions due to this issue.

This will render all protocol functions unusable that are relying on the Routing data of an auction: `AuctionHouse.purchase()`, `AuctionHouse.settle()`, `AuctionHouse.claimProceeds()`, `AuctionHouse.curate()`, `AuctionHouse.claimBids()`.

Thus most auctions, except the last one created, won't work correctly and will have multiple issues as a consequence due to the overwritten Routing information.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider incrementing `lotId` before line 174 in Auctioneer.sol in order to assign the correct storage Routing data to the `routing` variable:

```solidity
// Auctioneer.sol

+173       lotId = lotCounter++;  
174        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
(...)
+194           // lotId = lotCounter++; <--- @audit: removed
```
