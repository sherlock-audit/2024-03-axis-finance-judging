# Lot id is always set to 0 for new auctions

## Summary
Lot id is always set to 0 for new auctions

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating an auction, the lotId used for storing RoutingData is always 0 instead of the next lotId

```solidity
    function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {

        if (address(routing_.baseToken) == address(0) || address(routing_.quoteToken) == address(0))
        {
            revert InvalidParams();
        }

        // @audit lotId used is always 0. only updated to latest value later
        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];

        .....

        // @audit stores routing information in the incorrect
        routing.seller = msg.sender;
        routing.baseToken = routing_.baseToken;
        routing.quoteToken = routing_.quoteToken;
```

Hence all routing information associated with a lot will be lost. This breaks the entire protocol as lots cannot be identified correctly and almost everything requires identifying a lot correctly via the AcutionHouse contract using their lotId

## Impact

All auctions are effectively lost when there are multiple auctions

## Recommendation

Update the lotId before fetching the storage variable
