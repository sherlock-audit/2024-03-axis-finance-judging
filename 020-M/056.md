# Failure to check the function implementation of the callback will result in the curator being unable to collect fees.

## Summary

When `AuctionHouse::curate` is called by the curator, it will call the seller's `callback::onCurate`, but whether this process is successful or not, there is no check to ensure that the function runs successfully.

## Vulnerability Detail

If seller uses revert in `callback::onCurate`, the entire transaction will be rolled back, which will not affect the operation of other functions.

```solidity
   function curate(uint96 lotId_, bytes calldata callbackData_) external nonReentrant { 
...
                Callbacks.onCurate(routing.callbacks, lotId_, curatorFeePayout, true, callbackData_);
...
        emit Curated(lotId_, msg.sender);
    }
```

The onCurate function of callback is implemented as follows

```solidity
function onCurate(uint96 lotId, uint96 curatorFee, bool preFund, bytes calldata callbackData) external returns(bytes4) {
	revert("");
}
```

In this way, the curator cannot function normally.

## Impact

curator cannot collect fees

## Recommendation

If the specified curator needs to pay a fee, the seller should send the fee to the current contract in advance
