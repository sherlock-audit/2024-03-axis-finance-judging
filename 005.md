# Absence of Lot Settlement Check in refundBid() may result in Funds Getting Locked Up

## Summary
The `refundBid()` function requires a revert if the lot is not settled. 
```solidity
///             This function reverts if:
///             - the lot is not settled
```

However, this check is not implemented within the function.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Funds Getting Locked Up or Frozen Inside a Contract: 
If a `bid refund` is allowed before the `lot is settled`, it could potentially `lock up funds` within the contract. This could happen if the `refund` process is designed to return `funds` to the `bidder` but the lot's settlement process (which might involve transferring ownership or other assets) has not yet been completed. 

## Impact
This could lead to a situation where funds are stuck in the contract, inaccessible to the bidder, and potentially inaccessible to the contract itself if the settlement process is not completed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the function reverts if the lot is not settled by adding this check. 
```solidity
 _revertIfLotNotSettled(lotId_);
```
