# lack of deadline check in `auction()` will bypass minimum auction duration

## Summary
the `auction()` in `Auctioneer.sol` used to create auction and this function have some checks like minimum duration which is initialized with `1 day` in `EMPAM` and `FPAM` modules. but the issue is `auction()` doesnt have any deadline check and this issue can lead to transaction stuck in the mempool in market turbulence and auction creates in the past.

## Vulnerability Detail
the `auction()` in the `Auctioneer.sol` calls internal `auction()` in `Auction.sol` and checks that if `params_.start` is sets to zero, then auction starts with `block.timestamp` or seller gives future timestamp in order to start auction in the future. 
```solidity
lot.start = params_.start == 0 ? uint48(block.timestamp) : params_.start;
```
at this moment imagine seller wants to start auction after 30 min and sets `timestamp` to do this, but market have turbulence and seller's transaction gets stuck in the mempool and got executed after 6H for example, this will lead to some problems:
- auction starts in the past
- minimum duration check (1 day) doesn't matter (user can purposefully do that)
- the duration of auction will decrease
- sellers can purposefully execute `auction()` with low gas fee in order to decrease auction duration and bypass minimum auction duration, as they shouldn't.
- sellers creates auction in market turbulence and their transaction will be executed after some time and this will decrease their auction duration and their auction `timestamp` will start at the past .

as we asked protocol dev:
question:
> if someone able to create auction in less than minimum duration (1 days), should i consider this as a issue or it doesn't have any impact? 

answer:
> It would not be intended, and would be a bug we'd like to fix

## Impact
- auctions `timestamp` can start in the past.
- auction duration decrease

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function auction(
        uint96 lotId_,
        AuctionParams memory params_,
        uint8 quoteTokenDecimals_,
        uint8 baseTokenDecimals_
    ) external override onlyInternal returns (uint96 capacity) {
        // Start time must be zero or in the future
        if (params_.start > 0 && params_.start < uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            revert Auction_InvalidStart(params_.start, uint48(block.timestamp));
        }

        // Duration must be at least min duration
        if (params_.duration < minAuctionDuration) {
            revert Auction_InvalidDuration(params_.duration, minAuctionDuration);
        }

        // Create core market data
        Lot memory lot;
        lot.start = params_.start == 0 ? uint48(block.timestamp) : params_.start;
        lot.conclusion = lot.start + params_.duration;
        lot.quoteTokenDecimals = quoteTokenDecimals_;
        lot.baseTokenDecimals = baseTokenDecimals_;
        lot.capacityInQuote = params_.capacityInQuote;
        lot.capacity = params_.capacity;

        // Call internal createAuction function to store implementation-specific data
        _auction(lotId_, lot, params_.implParams);

        // Store lot data
        lotData[lotId_] = lot;

        return (lot.capacity);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- consider adding deadline logic  to `auction()` function and revert if function timestamp reaches given deadline treshhold
