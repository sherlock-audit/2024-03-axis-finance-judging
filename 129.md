# Incorrect Scalar Value in Elliptic Curve Multiplication - Compromised Public Key integrity

## Summary
The use of an incorrect scalar value, specifically a private key that does not adhere to cryptographic standards, in elliptic curve multiplication within the `ECIES` library can lead to the generation of an invalid public key, undermining the security of cryptographic operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

Current Implementation:
```solidity
function _ecMul(Point memory p, uint256 scalar) private view returns (Point memory p2) {
    // ... (elliptic curve multiplication using precompiled contract)
}
```
- `What Goes Wrong: The `_ecMul` function performs elliptic curve multiplication without validating the cryptographic suitability of the scalar value beyond its range, potentially resulting in an invalid public key.`


## Impact
- **Public Key Integrity**: An invalid public key cannot be used for secure communication, leading to failed encryption/decryption.
- **System Reliability**: Relying on invalid public keys can cause system-wide failures in cryptographic operations.
- **Security Breach**: If an invalid public key is not detected, it may lead to unauthorized access or loss of data.


## Code Snippet
The vulnerability arises from the lack of cryptographic suitability checks for the scalar value in the `_ecMul` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- **Cryptographic Standards Compliance**: Ensure scalar values (private keys) comply with cryptographic standards before use.
- **Input Validation**: Implement additional validation checks for scalar values within the `_ecMul` function or in the functions that call `_ecMul`.
