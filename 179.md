# A bidder cannot cancel its bid if a very large number of bids has been placed before the bidder

## Summary
A bidder cannot cancel its bid if a very large number of bids has been placed before the bidder
## Vulnerability Detail
In an EMPAM auction there is no limit on number of bids that can be placed, suppose In an auction a million bids are placed by bidders , now a bidder say Alice places a bid at 1000001 position so her `bidId = 1000001` but Alice want to cancel the bid so she calls `refundBid(0,1000001)` from AuctionHouse contract, but the transaction will fail because it will hit transaction gas limit and Alice would not be able to cancel the bid.

In `EMPAM.sol`
```solidity
function _refundBid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        uint64 bidId_,
        address
    ) internal override returns (uint96 refund) {
        // Set bid status to claimed
        bids[lotId_][bidId_].status = BidStatus.Claimed;

        // Remove bid from list of bids to decrypt
        uint64[] storage bidIds = auctionData[lotId_].bidIds;
        uint256 len = bidIds.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {
            if (bidIds[i] == bidId_) {
                bidIds[i] = bidIds[len - 1];
                bidIds.pop();
                break;
            }
        }

        // Return the amount to be refunded
        return bids[lotId_][bidId_].amount;
    }
```
where `bidIds.length` is number of total number of  bids placed. If a very large number of bids has been placed it will cause `_refundBid` to revert because of exceeding gas limit.  It is not necessary for bids to be malicious it could be that  too many users have placed the bids in that auction. 
## Impact
Medium because a user wanting to cancel their bids would not be able to cancel it.
