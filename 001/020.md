# Incorrect setting of lotId, makes the whole protocol obsolete

## Summary
The whole purpose of the ``Axis-Finance`` protocol is to allow users to create different auctions in order to bootstrap their tokens, or perform a partial sale. Auctions can be created via the ``AuctionHouse.sol`` contract by calling the [auction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L160-L284) function. Each auction has an unique ``lotId`` that is used to store the parameters for the auction such as ``baseToken``, ``quoteToken``, ``price``, etc.  In the [auction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L160-L284) function the ``lotId`` for each auction is set in the beginning of the function in the following way, and will always be 0. 
```solidity
Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
```
The problem is that ``lotId`` is set before it is updated on line [194](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L194).
```solidity
lotId = lotCounter++;
```
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The whole protocol, can support only one auction, if another auction is created it will overwrite the initial one, making the protocol obsolete. If the first auction is prefunded, and afterwards another auction is created all tokens from the first auction will be stuck in the ``Axis-Finance`` protocol. Creating auctions is permisionless, and doesn't require any funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set the ``Routing``  struct 
```solidity
Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
```
after ``lotId`` is updated
```solidity
lotId = lotCounter++;
```
on line [194](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L194) in the ``Auctioneer.sol`` contract
