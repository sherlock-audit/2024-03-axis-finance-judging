# routing uninitialized vulnerability

## Summary

There is an uninitialization vulnerability in routing, which may cause the user's transaction to not function properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Seller call auction creates an auction, and variable routing obtains the value of lotRouting[lotId]. The initialization value of lotId is 0, so routing actually obtains lotRouting[0].

If the seller does not intend to use the callback, since the cache of lotRouting[0] is used, the auction created by the seller will use the callback set by lotRouting[0], which will cause the auction to run in a manner that does not meet the seller's expectations.

#### Proof Of Concept

Coding

```solidity
    function test_success_givenCallbackIsSetPoc()
        external
        whenAuctionTypeIsAtomic
        whenAtomicAuctionModuleIsInstalled
        givenCallbackIsSet
    {
        // Create the auction
        vm.prank(_SELLER);
        _lotId = _auctionHouse.auction(_routingParams, _auctionParams, _INFO_HASH);

        // Assert values
        Auctioneer.Routing memory routing = _getLotRouting(_lotId);
        console.log("1 lotId:  %d",_lotId);
        console.logAddress(address(_callback));
        assertEq(address(routing.callbacks), address(_callback), "callback mismatch");
        

        _routingParams.callbacks = ICallback(address(0));
        _lotId = _auctionHouse.auction(_routingParams, _auctionParams, _INFO_HASH);
        console.log("1 lotId:  %d", _lotId);
        console.logAddress(address(_callback));
        assertEq(address(routing.callbacks), address(_callback), "callback mismatch");

    }
```

## Impact

The auction runs in a manner that is inconsistent with user logic, and attackers may use this as an attack vector to interfere with the running of the auction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

change `Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];` to `Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotCounter];`
