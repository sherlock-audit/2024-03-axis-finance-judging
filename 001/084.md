# Auctioneer.auction() function incorrectly updates lotRouting mapping with key always being lotId==0 which breaks the auction functionality entirely

## Summary
`auction()` function is responsible for creating a new auction lot. The `lotRouting` mapping contains the routing information for the specific `lotId`, and is widely used in the `AuctionHouse` contract, primarily in the `_getModuleForId()` function to load the auction module for the `lotId` on which auction-specific functions are called. But due to the fact that the `lotRouting` is updated incorrectly, every auction lot, starting with `lotId == 1`, would be inaccessible, and the very first auction with `lotId == 0` can be overwritten by anyone. In case of prefunding that would mean that the prefunded amount would be lost for the seller, and in the latter case can be stolen from him.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Auctioneer.auction()` function the the routing is updated based on an uninitialised `lotId`:
```solidity
function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) { //@audit
        // Check that the module for the auction type is valid
        // Validate routing parameters

        // Tokens must not be the zero address
        if (address(routing_.baseToken) == address(0) || address(routing_.quoteToken) == address(0))
        {
            revert InvalidParams();
        }
        
        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId]; //@audit lotId always zero here, should be lotCounter
        ...
}
```
The `lotId` initialization happens afterwards:
```solidity
            // Increment lot count and get ID
            lotId = lotCounter++;

            // Call module auction function to store implementation-specific data
            (lotCapacity) =
                auctionModule.auction(lotId, params_, quoteTokenDecimals, baseTokenDecimals);
            routing.auctionReference = auctionModule.VEECODE();
```
This effectively means that upon each call to the `auciton()` function the `lotRouting` mapping is updated for `lotId == 0` but the auction is created for the correct `lotId`. If the auction is prefunded, the prefunded amount would be sent and stored for `lotRouting[0]`. 
Each major function like `cancel()`, `bid()` etc. calls the internal `_getModuleForId()` which loads the module which is stored in the `lotRouting[lotId_].auctionReference` . But since reference is stored only for zeroth lotId, this would result on DoS for every lotId > 0.
Also, anyone can become the auction seller for the zeroth lotId and cancel the auction to steal the prefunded amount by calling the `cancel()` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The key for `lotRouting` should be the `lotCounter`:
```solidity
Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotCounter];
```
