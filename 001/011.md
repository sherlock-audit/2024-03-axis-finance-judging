# New auctions override old ones in `lotRouting` mapping

## Summary
In the `Auctioneer.sol` the `auction` function edits old auctions instead of creating a new slot at the `lotRouting` mapping
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that the the following lines will always edit the 0 element of the `lotRouting` mapping:
```solidity 
   function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
        // Check that the module for the auction type is valid
        // Validate routing parameters

        // Tokens must not be the zero address
        if (address(routing_.baseToken) == address(0) || address(routing_.quoteToken) == address(0))
        {
            revert InvalidParams();
        }

        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
  ```
Here the `lotId` variable will always be zero as it is only declared.
The argument is passed by storage so the following lines will indeed change the mapping:
```solidity
routing.seller = msg.sender;
        routing.baseToken = routing_.baseToken;
        routing.quoteToken = routing_.quoteToken;
...
 routing.derivativeReference = derivativeModule.VEECODE();
            routing.derivativeParams = routing_.derivativeParams;
            routing.wrapDerivative = routing_.wrapDerivative;
```

## Impact
As a result the whole mapping will not be working breaking core functionality of the protocol - High.
