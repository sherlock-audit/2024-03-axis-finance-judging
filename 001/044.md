# lotRouting will be always with lotId = 0 in Auctioneer smart contract

## Summary
During the creation of an auction in the `Auctioneer.auction` function, the seller passes routing arguments, which are then recorded in the `lotRouting` mapping. However, `lotRouting` always uses `lotId = 0`, which leads to inconsistency with the module `lotId` and issues with creating new auctions.

## Vulnerability Detail
All users who call the `auction` function to create an auction will have `lotId = 0` in `lotRouting`, because...
```solidity
function auction(
            RoutingParams calldata routing_,
            Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
            string calldata infoHash_
        ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {  // lotId = 0
            ///code

            Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId]; // lotId = 0
 }
```

After that, `lotId` is incremented, and the auction function is called in the module with `lotId = 1`:
```solidity
// Increment lot count and get ID
            lotId = lotCounter++;

            // Call module auction function to store implementation-specific data
            (lotCapacity) = auctionModule.auction(
                lotId,
                params_,
                quoteTokenDecimals,
                baseTokenDecimals
            );
```
Store curation information with lotId = 1.
```solidity
FeeData storage fees = lotFees[lotId];
            fees.curator = routing_.curator;
            fees.curated = false;
```


After the first auction is created:
   lotRouting: lotId = 0
   module: lotId = 1
   lotFees: lotId = 1
   
After the second auction is created:
   lotRouting: lotId = 0
   module: lotId = 2
   lotFees: lotId = 2

## Impact

The inconsistency between the `Auctioneer's lotId` and the `Module's lotId` and `lotFees lotId` is dangerous.

## Recommendation
Consider incrementing the `lotCounter` before `lotRouting`:
```diff
+lotId = lotCounter++;
Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];
```
