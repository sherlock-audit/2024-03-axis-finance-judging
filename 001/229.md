# Use of unintiliazed `lotId` to store auction routing data

## Summary

`Auctioneer::auction()`  stores auction routing data in storage using an uninitialized `lotId`  as a result the same storage slot is used for all subsequent auction
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L160-L174

## Vulnerability Detail

The auction routing data is stored using an uninitialized variable `lotId`  which is 0 at the time it's used to reference the storage slot where the routing data for an auction will be stored
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L174
as a result subsequent new auctions will override the routing data for the previous auction and the `lotId` returned will reference an empty storage slot as the variable is later initialized with the counter

## Impact

1. loss of seller's pre-funded auction funds
2. DOS on all auction activities(purchase, bid, claim,etc) because returned `lotId` references an uninitialized storage slot

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
initialize the lotId before use , ideally 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L194
 should come before
