# Error in specifying the lotId corresponding to routing when creating an auction

## Summary
The incorrect specification of the lotId corresponding to the routing caused the lotRouting to be incorrectly overwritten when the auction was created.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Auctioneer contract, the user can create a new auction by calling the auction function. In it, the corresponding `routing` is retrieved from the `lotRouting` mapping based on the `lotId`, and the corresponding value in its structure is modified and stored throughout the creation process. 

The normal case would be to iterate over the value of `lotCounter` and create an empty routing from with the new lotCounter. 

However, here the `lotId` is assigned after the routing is acquired, and since `lotId` is a temporary value in the function, each time a new `routing` is created it will go to the value of the routing that `lotId = 0` corresponds to.

## Impact
This results in the routing only ever being able to fetch the value corresponding to lotId = 0, and having its value modified unintentionally each time the function is called.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to move the assignment of lotId before the creation of a new routing. (Move `lotId = lotCounter++;` before `Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];`)
