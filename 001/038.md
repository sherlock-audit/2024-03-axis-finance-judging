# User could lose funds due to `Auctioneer.sol::auction` isn't storing new routings correctly

## Summary
User who is about to cancel auction won't get his base tokens back, because the stored funds on its routing's id will be 0, due to `Auctioneer.sol::auction` recording a new routing on zero index every time it's called

## Vulnerability Detail
Possible scenario:
(Note that AuctionHouse inheritance Auctioneer and Alice'sLotId is bigger than 0)
1. Alice would like to sell some base tokens for quote tokens and executes `AuctionHouse.sol::auction`, which is going to `transferFrom` her base tokens to `AuctionHouse` and return Alice'sLotId.
2. Alice calls `AuctionHouse.sol::cancel`, but she is going to receive 0 amount of base tokens, because `routing.funding > 0` check is not passed, because `AuctionHouse.sol::lotRouting[/Alice'sLotId/]` will return new(empty) `Routing`.

## Impact
User loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement `lotId`'s value before getting `routing`'s reference as shown below:
```diff
 function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
        // Check that the module for the auction type is valid
        // Validate routing parameters

        // Tokens must not be the zero address
        if (address(routing_.baseToken) == address(0) || address(routing_.quoteToken) == address(0))
        {
            revert InvalidParams();
        }

+          // Increment lot count and get ID
+          lotId = lotCounter++;

        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];

            ...

-            // Increment lot count and get ID
-            lotId = lotCounter++;

            ...

        emit AuctionCreated(lotId, routing.auctionReference, infoHash_);
    }
```
