# Impossible to make multiple auctions because lotRouting is not set properly

## Summary
It's impossible to make more than one auction.

## Vulnerability Detail
`lotId` is not set until after accessing `lotRouting[lotId]`. This causes
`Auctioneer.auction` to only ever access and set the `lotRouting` element at index `0`.
Every attempt to create an auction will overwrite the element at `lotRouting[0]` rather than creating a new entry at the expected index in `lotRouting`.

## Impact
It's impossible to have more than one auction. This issue will be experienced, and it will cause the contract to be unusable.

## Code Snippet
[Auctioneer: auction ln174](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L174)
```solidity
Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];

...

// Increment lot count and get ID
lotId = lotCounter++;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

Created custom test
```solidity
    function test_createTwoAuctions() external whenAuctionTypeIsAtomic whenAtomicAuctionModuleIsInstalled {
        address SELLER1 = address(0x7);
        address SELLER2 = address(0x8);

        vm.prank(SELLER1);
        uint96 lotId1 = _auctionHouse.auction(_routingParams, _auctionParams, "info hash 1");
        Auctioneer.Routing memory routing1 = _getLotRouting(lotId1);
        assertEq(routing1.seller, SELLER1, "seller for auction 1 mismatch");

        vm.prank(SELLER2);
        uint96 lotId2 = _auctionHouse.auction(_routingParams, _auctionParams, "info hash 2");
        Auctioneer.Routing memory routing2 = _getLotRouting(lotId2);
        assertEq(routing2.seller, SELLER2, "seller for auction 2 mismatch");

        routing1 = _getLotRouting(lotId1);
        assertEq(routing1.seller, SELLER1, "seller for auction 1 has been unintentionally overwritten");
    }
```

## Recommendation
set `lotId` before accessing `lotRouting[lotId]`
