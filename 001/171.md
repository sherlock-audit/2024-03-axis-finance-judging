# Auction with lotId > 0 is always not handled as expected due to empty auction routing information

## Summary
If there are Multiple Auctions, all auctions information are messed to empty auction routing information

## Vulnerability Detail
`Auctioneer.sol::auction()` always does not set routing information for lotId greater than zero.
```solidity
    function auction(
        RoutingParams calldata routing_,
        Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
        string calldata infoHash_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
....
@       Routing storage routing = lotRouting[lotId];

        bool requiresPrefunding;
        uint96 lotCapacity;
        {
....
            // Increment lot count and get ID
@           lotId = lotCounter++;

            // Call module auction function to store implementation-specific data
            (lotCapacity) =
                auctionModule.auction(lotId, params_, quoteTokenDecimals, baseTokenDecimals);
            routing.auctionReference = auctionModule.VEECODE();
....
        }

        // Store routing information
        routing.seller = msg.sender;
        routing.baseToken = routing_.baseToken;
        routing.quoteToken = routing_.quoteToken;
....

        // Derivative
        if (fromKeycode(routing_.derivativeType) != bytes5("")) {
....
            // Store derivative information
            routing.derivativeReference = derivativeModule.VEECODE();
            routing.derivativeParams = routing_.derivativeParams;
            routing.wrapDerivative = routing_.wrapDerivative;
        }
    }
```
As you can see above code snippet, `routing` storage variable is as `lotRouting[0]`.
So whenever auctioneer creates auction, routing data is saved in `lotRouting[0]`, this means that if there are multiple auctions, all auctions' information are messed.

## Impact
Due to empty auction information, auction is invalid.  auctioneer funds are locked in protocol, or lost if try to cancel because routing.seller is address(0).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
At the beginning of `Auctioneer.sol::auction()` function, place the line to increment lot count and get ID.
