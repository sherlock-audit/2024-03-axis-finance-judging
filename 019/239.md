# Predictable Symmetric Keys from Salt Duplication - A Threat to Encryption Integrity

## Summary
In the`ECIES` library, function `deriveSymmetricKey` Lacks mechanisms to guarantee salt uniqueness, risking key predictability, and `decrypt` Function does not validate salt, which may cause decryption errors if salt is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function deriveSymmetricKey(uint256 sharedSecret_, uint256 s1_) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sharedSecret_, s1_)));
}
```
```solidity
    function decrypt(
        uint256 ciphertext_,
        Point memory ciphertextPubKey_,
        uint256 privateKey_,
        uint256 salt_
    ) public view returns (uint256 message_) {
        uint256 sharedSecret = recoverSharedSecret(ciphertextPubKey_, privateKey_);
      
        // @audit ... (omitted for brevity)
        uint256 symmetricKey = deriveSymmetricKey(sharedSecret, salt_);
        message_ = ciphertext_ ^ symmetricKey;
    }
```
Risk:
Salt reuse in deriveSymmetricKey can lead to predictable keys.
Incorrect salt in decrypt leads to incorrect decryption.

### SITUATION POC
simulate an encryption and decryption process where Alice sends an encrypted message to Bob using the ECIES library. We'll show how salt reuse and incorrect salt can lead to issues.

Here, Alice uses the `deriveSymmetricKey` function to encrypt a message for Bob, and Bob uses the same function to decrypt it. If Bob uses the correct salt, he will successfully decrypt the message. If he uses an incorrect salt, the decryption will fail, and the `isSaltCorrect` flag will be set to false.

To see salt reuse, we call alice Sends Message multiple times with the same `sharedSecret` and `salt`, showing that the `ciphertext` remains the same, indicating that the symmetric key has not changed.

To demonstrate the impact of incorrect salt, we would call bob Receives Message with a different salt than what was used by Alice, resulting in an incorrect decryption.
## Impact
High Level issue because it affects the fundamental security of the encryption scheme. If an attacker can predict or determine the symmetric key due to salt reuse, they could potentially decrypt sensitive data off-chain.
- Predictable symmetric keys can lead to unauthorized data decryption
- Incorrect decryption results in corrupted data, leading to potential misinformation.
- Replay Attacks: Encrypted messages can be replayed or decrypted if the symmetric key is known from a previous session with the same salt.
- Compromised Data Integrity: If keys are predictable, the integrity of the data being transmitted is at risk.


## Code Snippet
The vulnerability arises from the use of a potentially reused salt in the deriveSymmetricKey function,and the decrypt function  as shown above.

## Recommendation

- Implement a mechanism to ensure that a unique salt is used for each encryption operation. This could be a random number, a timestamp, or a nonce that is guaranteed to be unique.
- Store and manage salts securely, ensuring they are not reused across sessions or for different users.
