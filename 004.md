# execOnModule() is called by owner instead of parent resulting in Access control breach

## Summary
The  `execOnModule()` function  can be used to perform administrative functions on a `module`, such as setting parameters or calling permissioned functions. 
The requirement is that it should be called by `parent` according to Natspec but instead, `onlyOwner` modifier is used rather that `onlyParent`.

According to Natspec:
```solidity
/// @dev            This function reverts if:
/// @dev            - The caller is not the parent
```

## Vulnerability Detail
`onlyParent` modifier is defined in `Module` abstract contract as follows:

## Impact
There is conflict in `Access control` where `owner` is able to call a function that should only be invoked by `Parent`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `onlyParent` modifier instead of `onlyOwner` by first importing `Module` contract to` WithModules` contract.
