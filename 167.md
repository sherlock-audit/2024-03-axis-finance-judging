# Lack of Mechanism for Handling Unclaimed Bids Post-Settlement

## Summary
- Unclaimed Bid Handling: There is no explicit logic for handling bids that remain unclaimed after the settlement, including any associated timeouts or expiration policies, potentially leading to funds being indefinitely locked.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The contract allows bidders to claim their bids after settlement but does not specify what happens to unclaimed bids.

What Goes Wrong: `Funds from unclaimed bids could remain locked within the contract indefinitely, without a clear policy for their release or redistribution.`
```solidity
function _claimBid(
    uint96 lotId_,
    uint64 bidId_
) internal returns (BidClaim memory bidClaim, bytes memory auctionOutput_) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Logic for claiming a bid post-settlement
    Bid storage bidData = bids[lotId_][bidId_];
    bidData.status = BidStatus.Claimed;

    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit No logic for handling bids that remain unclaimed after a certain period
}
```


## Impact
 The auction contract does not provide explicit logic for addressing bids that remain unclaimed after the settlement, potentially leading to funds being indefinitely locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Expiration Policy: Implement an expiration policy for unclaimed bids, after which the funds can be redistributed or handled according to the protocol's governance decisions.
- Automated Claim Process: Consider an automated process that allows bidders to claim their funds without manual intervention, reducing the likelihood of unclaimed bids.
- User Notifications: Develop a system to notify users of unclaimed bids, prompting them to take action before the expiration deadline.
