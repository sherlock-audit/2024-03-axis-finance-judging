# Wrong Information or no information, may be linked to an auction using the infoHash

## Summary
 Bidders have to go onchain to check the params set up by the `Sellers` to confirm truly the info give in infohash is accurate, However that can be tiresome to bidders who are not using callbacks therefore,  They will have to rely on The Info-Hash, as The main place to check about an auction. However Sellers may fill wrong information in the IPFS, and link the info Hash to the  auction where the details dont correspond.
## Vulnerability Detail
1. Sellers set up an `auction`. 
2. They create a IPFS hash where they may lie about an auction or fill no details at all.
3. the event is emitted with that hash
4.Users have to go onchain to view the params filled in which is very ineffective.
## Impact
Inacurate information misleading `Bidders` in infoHash or no information given to user

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. I highly advise the protocol creates ER721 contracts that will be minted during Auction creation. 
2. The ERC721 contracts will be minted to the sellers and they will contain the info about an auction since it was generated automatically by the params filled and validated by the user.
3. This will then act as the receipts which bidders can refer to.
5. for example the uniswapv3 nfts minted to liquidity providiers
