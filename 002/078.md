# Auction creators may lose their funds if the quote token behaves like LEND token, reverting on transfer of 0 tokens.

## Summary
The following can be found in the `readme` file.
```solidity
Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behaviour with the smart contracts?

In general, it's possible that some of these tokens will be used to create auctions. 
However, we don't commit to supporting every ERC20 token. 
We only care about issues with these tokens that would result in loss of funds from users or the protocol 
as a result of an auction being created with one of these tokens.
```
It implies that issues related to certain types of tokens can be accepted if they result in a loss of `funds`.

An `auction creator` who wishes to purchase `LEND` tokens can create an `auction`.
No one can prevent him from doing so.
However, if the `auction` is not settled, the `creator` should be able to retrieve his `base` tokens.
Unfortunately, this retrieval is not possible and the `creator's funds` become locked within the `auction house`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `seller` initiates a `batch auction` with the intention of purchasing `LEND` tokens.
However, the `auction` encounters one of the following situations.
- No `bidders` during the `auction`.
- Insufficient `quote` tokens to fill the required amounts.

So the `seller` is unable to purchase any `LEND` tokens through this `auction`.
To recover his `base` tokens, he can invoke the `claimProceeds` function.
```solidity
function claimProceeds(
    uint96 lotId_,
    bytes calldata callbackData_
) external override nonReentrant {
    (uint96 purchased_, uint96 sold_, uint96 payoutSent_) =  // @audit, purchased = 0
        _getModuleForId(lotId_).claimProceeds(lotId_);
}
```
The `totalInLessFees` will be `0` due to the `purchased` is `0`.
Despite this, there is a step where `quote` tokens are sent to the `seller`.
```solidity
function claimProceeds(
    uint96 lotId_,
    bytes calldata callbackData_
) external override nonReentrant {
    uint96 totalInLessFees;
    {
        (, uint96 toProtocol) = calculateQuoteFees(
            lotFees[lotId_].protocolFee, lotFees[lotId_].referrerFee, false, purchased_
        );
        unchecked {
            totalInLessFees = purchased_ - toProtocol;
        }
    }

    // Send payment in bulk to the address dictated by the callbacks address
    // If the callbacks contract is configured to receive quote tokens, send the quote tokens to the callbacks contract and call the onClaimProceeds callback
    // If not, send the quote tokens to the seller and call the onClaimProceeds callback
    _sendPayment(routing.seller, totalInLessFees, routing.quoteToken, routing.callbacks);
}
```
The `LEND` token consistently reverts when attempting to transfer `0` amounts.
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns(bool) {
      require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
      require(balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]);   // @audit, here

      balances[msg.sender] = safeSub(balances[msg.sender],_value);
      balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to],_value);

      Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
      return true;
 }
```
## Impact
Users' funds can be locked.

        );
        unchecked {
            totalInLessFees = purchased_ - toProtocol;
        }
    }

    // Send payment in bulk to the address dictated by the callbacks address
    // If the callbacks contract is configured to receive quote tokens, send the quote tokens to the callbacks contract and call the onClaimProceeds callback
    // If not, send the quote tokens to the seller and call the onClaimProceeds callback
+    if (totalInLessFees > 0) {
        _sendPayment(routing.seller, totalInLessFees, routing.quoteToken, routing.callbacks);
