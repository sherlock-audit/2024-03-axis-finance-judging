# Some tokens will cause DOS of claimProceeds function

## Summary
In the `claimProceeds` function, there is a transfer that gives the prefunded amount that was not sold back to the seller. However in most cases, the prefunded amount will be 0 causing the transfer to refund for some tokens which do not support 0 transfers(e.g. LEND). 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the claimProceeds function there is no check if the transfer amount is going to be zero:

If the base token is LEND or any other token that does not support the zero transfer - the claimProceeds will function revert, declining the seller their profit for the current lot, if the prefunding refund is greater than zero which will be a very usual case.
## Impact
The seller will never claim their profit and the tokens will be stuck forever in the contract - High.

## Recommendation
Check if the prefundedRefund is greater than zero before executing the transfer.
