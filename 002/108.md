# claimProceeds() breaks the ability of bidders claiming their bids

## Summary
`claimProceeds()` when called sets the status of the EMPAM auction into a state which makes the `claimBids()` function revert due to invalid state validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimProceeds()` function is used to return the remaining funding back to the seller. It is supposed to be called after the settlement process happens. It can be called by anyone.

At the EMPAM.sol we can see that the `claimProceeds()` is setting the `auctionData` status to `Claimed`. This status is used so that the seller cannot claim the proceeds twice:
```solidity
function _claimProceeds(uint96 lotId_)
        internal
        override
        returns (uint96 purchased, uint96 sold, uint96 payoutSent)
    {
        auctionData[lotId_].status = Auction.Status.Claimed;
        [...]
    }
```

The `claimBids()` function is used to send the results of the auction (either the baseToken if won, or quoteToken if not) back to the bidders. The expectation is that this function is called after the settlement process happens and this is supposed to be ensured by the following function in the `AuctionModule` contract:
```solidity
function claimBids(
        uint96 lotId_,
        uint64[] calldata bidIds_
    )
        external
        override
        onlyInternal
        returns (BidClaim[] memory bidClaims, bytes memory auctionOutput)
    {
        [...]
        _revertIfLotNotSettled(lotId_);
        [...]
    }
```
however the `_revertIfLotNotSettled()` is going to revert if the state of the auction is anything but `Settled`:
```solidity
function _revertIfLotNotSettled(uint96 lotId_) internal view override {
        // Auction must be settled
        if (auctionData[lotId_].status != Auction.Status.Settled) {
            revert Auction_WrongState(lotId_);
        }
    }
```
Hence after `claimProceeds()` is called, all `claimBids()` will revert.

## Impact
`claimProceeds()` could be called by any malicious users and it will prevent the bidders who didn't claim their bids from claiming them. The malicious user could backrun the `settle()` call and hence prevent all the bidders from taking their bids.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
EMPAM.sol:
```diff
function _revertIfLotNotSettled(uint96 lotId_) internal view override {
        // Auction must be settled
-        if (auctionData[lotId_].status != Auction.Status.Settled) {
+        if (auctionData[lotId_].status != Auction.Status.Settled && auctionData[lotId_].status != Auction.Status.Claimed) {
            revert Auction_WrongState(lotId_);
        }
    }
```
