# `claimProceeds()` will be DoS'ed for a fully filled auction if a baseToken reverts on 0 amount transfers.

## Summary
After a lot has concluded, seller has the ability to claim proceeds from the lot. To do that, he must call `claimProceeds()` function of the AuctionHouse. The function will send him his payment and will try to refund any unused capacity. The problem is that, when the amount to refund is 0, the function will still try to transfer base tokens to the seller. In that case, it will always revert if the specified token does not support zero amount transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
During a call to `claimProceeds()` it calculates the amount of unused capacity to refund and tries sending it to the seller.

```solidity
uint96 prefundingRefund = routing.funding + payoutSent_ - sold_;
unchecked {
    routing.funding -= prefundingRefund;
}
Transfer.transfer(
    routing.baseToken,
    _getAddressGivenCallbackBaseTokenFlag(
        routing.callbacks,
        routing.seller
    ),
    prefundingRefund,
    false
);
```
If prefundingRefund is 0, which will happen when a lot has been fully filled, the transfer will always revert for a token that does not support 0 amount transfers.
## Impact
Permanent DoS of the `claimProceeds()` function leading to the seller not being able to claim proceeds for his lot.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only send the refund when `prefundingRefund` is greater than 0.
