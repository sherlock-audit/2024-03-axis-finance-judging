# Atomic auction remaining funding is stuck after conclusion timestamp

## Summary
Atomic auctions (FPAM) could be created with prefunding. An atomic auction could conclude with not entire lot being purchased by the bidders. In case that happens and the conclusion date has passed the remaining of the `baseToken` is stuck at the `AuctionHouse` with now possibility of withdrawal by the seller.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an atomic auction is created it can be done so with prefunding specified. In that case the `baseToken` is transfered to the `AuctionHouse` during auction creation using `Auctioneer.auction()`. The seller can back off of the auction by calling `Auctioneer.cancel()`, this function then calls `AuctionModule.cancelAuction()` where we can see limitations:
```solidity
function cancelAuction(uint96 lotId_) external override onlyInternal {
        // Validation
        _revertIfLotInvalid(lotId_);
        _revertIfLotConcluded(lotId_);
        [...]
    }
```
it reverts if the lot is concluded. The `_revertIfLotConcluded()` contains the following conditions:
```solidity
function _revertIfLotConcluded(uint96 lotId_) internal view virtual {
        // Beyond the conclusion time
        if (lotData[lotId_].conclusion < uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
        }

        // Capacity is sold-out, or cancelled
        if (lotData[lotId_].capacity == 0) revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
    }
```
so the `AuctionModule.cancelAuction()` will revert after conclusion timestamp.
## Impact
Sellers remaining funding is locked in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After discussing the issue with protocol team, the conclusion was made that the prefunded FPAM functions should not be allowed. hence such auction configuration should revert on creation. The following changes could be proposed to the code:

Auctioneer.sol:
```diff
        {
            // Load auction type module, this checks that it is installed.
            // We load it here vs. later to avoid two checks.
            AuctionModule auctionModule =
                AuctionModule(_getLatestModuleIfActive(routing_.auctionType));

            // Confirm tokens are within the required decimal range
            uint8 baseTokenDecimals = routing_.baseToken.decimals();
            uint8 quoteTokenDecimals = routing_.quoteToken.decimals();

            if (
                auctionModule.TYPE() != Module.Type.Auction || baseTokenDecimals < 6
                    || baseTokenDecimals > 18 || quoteTokenDecimals < 6 || quoteTokenDecimals > 18
            ) revert InvalidParams();

            // Increment lot count and get ID
            lotId = lotCounter++;

            // Call module auction function to store implementation-specific data
            (lotCapacity) =
                auctionModule.auction(lotId, params_, quoteTokenDecimals, baseTokenDecimals);
            routing.auctionReference = auctionModule.VEECODE();

            // Prefunding is required for batch auctions
            // Check that this is not incorrectly overridden
            if (auctionModule.auctionType() == Auction.AuctionType.Batch && !routing_.prefunded) {
                revert InvalidParams();
            }
+           if (auctionModule.auctionType() == Auction.AuctionType.Atomic && routing_.prefunded) {
+               revert InvalidParams();
+           }

            requiresPrefunding = routing_.prefunded;
        }
```
