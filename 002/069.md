# [H-2] - Sellers can cancel auctions just in the conclusion timestamp

## Summary
Sellers can cancel auctions just in the conclusion timestamp, locking bidders' funds in the system 

## Vulnerability Detail
Attack flow:
1. Malicious seller (Who never had an intend to exchange any tokens), creates a batch auction
2. The auction is going as expected, every bider can bid or refund his bid
3. Some time passes and now the auction is near conclusion. The seller calls the `Auctioneer::cancel` function and a malicious miner sets the block.timestamp to be equal to the conclusion time.

With this the attack is performed! Checks about the time that is passing are performed in both `Auction::cancelAuction()` and `EMPAM::_cancelAuction()` functions. These are the performed checks:
Check performed in the `Auction::cancelAuction()`:
```javascript
function _revertIfLotConcluded(uint96 lotId_) internal view virtual {
        // Beyond the conclusion time
        if (lotData[lotId_].conclusion < uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
        }

        // Capacity is sold-out, or cancelled
        if (lotData[lotId_].capacity == 0) revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
    }
```
Check performed in the `EMPAM::_cancelAuction()`:
```javascript
 function _revertIfLotActive(uint96 lotId_) internal view override {
        if (
            auctionData[lotId_].status == Auction.Status.Created
                && lotData[lotId_].start <= block.timestamp
                && lotData[lotId_].conclusion > block.timestamp
        ) revert Auction_WrongState(lotId_);
    }
```
As seen here, both the checks doesn't revert when `block.timestamp == lotData[lotId_].conclusion`, which means that it's possible for the malicious seller to cancel the auction at the conclusion time and receive the assets he prefunded!
## Impact
The malicious user performed the attack at an extremely low cost (the only thing he should pay are the gas fees, since the prefunded funds are send back to him in the `Auctioneer::cancel()` function) and all the bidders funds remain locked in the system since they can neither refund their bids(because the auction isn't active) or call the `AuctionHouse::claimBids()` function since the auction was canceled.

## Tool used
Manual Review
PoC:
```solidity
function testReverts_whenLotIsConcluded()
        external
        whenAuctionTypeIsBatch
        whenBatchAuctionModuleIsInstalled
        givenSellerHasBaseTokenBalance(_LOT_CAPACITY)
        givenSellerHasBaseTokenAllowance(_LOT_CAPACITY)
        givenLotIsCreated
    {
        vm.warp(_startTime + _duration);
        vm.prank(_SELLER);
        _auctionHouse.cancel(_lotId, bytes(""));
    }
```
Paste it in `cancelAuction.t.sol`

## Recommendation
either fix the check performed in the `Auction::cancelAuction()` function or the check performed in the `EMPAM::_cancelAuction()`function like this:
```diff
function _revertIfLotConcluded(uint96 lotId_) internal view virtual {
        // Beyond the conclusion time
--        if (lotData[lotId_].conclusion < uint48(block.timestamp)) {
++  if (lotData[lotId_].conclusion <= uint48(block.timestamp))
            revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
        }

        // Capacity is sold-out, or cancelled
        if (lotData[lotId_].capacity == 0) revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
    }
```
or
```diff
 function _revertIfLotActive(uint96 lotId_) internal view override {
        if (
            auctionData[lotId_].status == Auction.Status.Created
                && lotData[lotId_].start <= block.timestamp
--               && lotData[lotId_].conclusion > block.timestamp
++               && lotData[lotId_].conclusion >= block.timestamp
        ) revert Auction_WrongState(lotId_);
    }
```
