# Remaining funds of FMAP auctions cannot be recovered once auction is concluded

## Summary
Remaining funds of FMAP auctions cannot be recovered once auction is concluded

## Vulnerability Detail

Auctions cannot be cancelled after its conclusion timestamp has passed

```solidity
    function cancelAuction(uint96 lotId_) external override onlyInternal {
        // Validation
        _revertIfLotInvalid(lotId_);
        _revertIfLotConcluded(lotId_);
```

```solidity
    function _revertIfLotConcluded(uint96 lotId_) internal view virtual {
        // Beyond the conclusion time
        if (lotData[lotId_].conclusion < uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
        }
```

This is problematic for prefunded FMAP auctions as the only way to recover tokens for such auctions is by cancelling. Hence there would be no way to recover these funds

## Impact

Lost assets for the seller

## Code Snippet

cancel auction reverts if conclusion timestamp has passed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow FMAP functions to be cancelled even after conclusion / add another method to retrieve remaining funds from FMAP auctions
