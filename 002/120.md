## Vulnerability Detail

in claimBids process:

Check whether the current state is settled state. If it is not settled state, it will be revert.

If a malicious seller calls the claimProceeds function before all users have claimed their funds, the status of the current auction will be changed to `Claimed`

Therefore, users will no longer be able to call the claimBids function to claim funds because the current auction status is no longer `Settled`

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It may be better to judge changes in state variables according to the OR operation. For example, when switching to the settled state, the operator uses `|=`, but the judgment of many state variables needs to be redesigned.
