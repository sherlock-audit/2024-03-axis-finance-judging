# The auction creator can not claim the Proceeds if some bidders have already claimed their bids.

## Summary
The `batch auction creator` `pre-funds` `base` tokens before the `auction` starts.
The `curator fee` may be added.
After the `auction` settles, `bidders` can claim their `bids` and the `auction creator` can claim purchased `quote` tokens and any remaining `base` tokens.
However, if some `bidders` have already claimed their `bids`, the calculation of remaining `base` tokens will be underflowed, and the `auction creator` won't be able to claim the `Proceeds`.
These `funds` will remain locked in the `auction house`.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user creates a `batch auction`, he should `pre-fund` the `base` tokens.
```solidity
function auction(
    RoutingParams calldata routing_,
    Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
    string calldata infoHash_
) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
    if (auctionModule.auctionType() == Auction.AuctionType.Batch && !routing_.prefunded) {
        revert InvalidParams();
    }
    if (requiresPrefunding == true) {
        routing.funding = lotCapacity;
    }
}
```
When the `auction` settles,we compute the following metrics.
- `purchased`: The amount of `quote` tokens purchased during the `auction.
- `sold`: The amount of `base` tokens sold
- `partialPayout`: The partial payout amount of `base` tokens sold to the `marginal bidder`.
```solidity
function settle(uint96 lotId_)
    external
    virtual
    override
    onlyInternal
    returns (Settlement memory settlement, bytes memory auctionOutput)
{
    lotData[lotId_].purchased = settlement.totalIn;
    lotData[lotId_].sold = settlement.totalOut;
    lotData[lotId_].partialPayout = settlement.pfPayout;
}
```
And the `routing.funding` is decreased by the `partialPayout`.
```solidity
function settle(uint96 lotId_) external override nonReentrant {
    if (settlement.pfBidder != address(0)) {
        unchecked {
            routing.funding -= uint96(settlement.pfPayout);
        }
    }
}
```
At this stage, we ensuer that `routing.funding + partialPayout >= sold`.

When `bidders` claim their `bids`, the `routing.funding` is reduced by the claimed amount.
```solidity
function claimBids(uint96 lotId_, uint64[] calldata bidIds_) external override nonReentrant {
    unchecked {
        routing.funding -= bidClaim.payout;
    }
}
```
However, the `sold` remains constant.
It is possible for the sum of `routing.funding` and `partialPayout` to be less than the `sold`.
```solidity
function claimProceeds(
    uint96 lotId_,
    bytes calldata callbackData_
) external override nonReentrant {
    (uint96 purchased_, uint96 sold_, uint96 payoutSent_) =
        _getModuleForId(lotId_).claimProceeds(lotId_);

    uint96 prefundingRefund = routing.funding + payoutSent_ - sold_; // @audit, here
    unchecked {
        routing.funding -= prefundingRefund;
    }
}
```
As a result, the `claiming of Proceeds` will be reverted.
## Impact
Users' funds will be locked.
