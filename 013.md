# [H-1] - Malicious user can block the `AuctionHouse::settle()` function

## Summary
Malicious user can charge the `bidIds` array with unlimited number of minimum amount bids and then decrypt as many as them as possible to block the `AuctionHouse::settle()` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
Attack flow:
1. Someone creates EMPA(Encrypted Marginal Price Auction).
2. The auction goes as planed. Users' bids are pushed to the `bidIds` array, but a malicious user calls the `AuctionHouse::bid()` function over and over again with the minimum bid amount
3. Then after some time the auction ends and the malicious user calls `EMPAM::decryptAndSortBids()` function a couple of time with big number `_num` as input to decrypt as many bids as possible without making the function to revert due out of gas error.

With this the attack is performed. The bids are already decrypted and have been insert into the `decryptedBids` array. From now on no matter who calls the `AuctionHouse::settle()` function it will revert because in the following code block in the `EMPAM::_getLotMarginalPrice()` function:
```javascript
{
            Queue storage queue = decryptedBids[lotId_];
            uint96 lastPrice;
            uint64 lastBidId;
            uint256 numBids = queue.getNumBids();
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < numBids; i++) {
                // A bid can be considered if:
                // - the bid price is greater than or equal to the minimum
                // - previous bids did not fill the capacity
                //
                // There is no need to check if the bid is the minimum bid size, as this was checked during decryption

                // Get bid info
                (uint64 bidId, uint96 amountIn, uint96 price) = _getNextBid(queue, baseScale);

                // If the price is below the minimum price, then determine a marginal price from the previous bids with the knowledge that no other bids will be considered
                // This will also handle a zero price returned from `_getNextBid()`, since `minPrice` is always greater than zero
                if (price < lotAuctionData.minPrice) {
                    // We know that the lastPrice was not sufficient to fill capacity or the loop would have exited
                    // We check if minimum price can result in a fill. If so, find the exact marginal price between last price and minimum price
                    // If not, we set the marginal price to the minimum price. Whether the capacity filled meets the minimum filled will be checked later in the settlement process.
                    if (

                    } else {
                        result.marginalPrice = lotAuctionData.minPrice; // note this cannot be zero since it is checked above
                    }

                    // If the marginal price is re-calculated and is the same as the previous, we need to set the marginal bid id, otherwise the previous bid will not be able to claim.

                    }

                    // Calculate the capacity expended in the same way as before, instead of setting it to `capacity`
                    // This will normally equal `capacity`, except when rounding would cause the the capacity expended to be slightly less than `capacity`
                    result.capacityExpended =
                        Math.mulDivDown(result.totalAmountIn, baseScale, result.marginalPrice); // updated based on the marginal price
                    break;
                }

                // The current price will now be considered, so we can set this

                }
            }
        }
```
with for loop this big and a `decryptedBids` array as big as the malicious user made it there is no way that the function won't revert due to out of gas error!
And even if it doesn't revert there, it has a second chance to do so in the in the following block of code, placed in the `EMPAM::_settle()` function, again because of out of gas error:
```javascript
{
            Queue storage queue = decryptedBids[lotId_];
            uint256 remainingBids = queue.getNumBids();
            if (remainingBids > 0) {
                for (uint256 i = remainingBids - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                    uint64 bidId = queue.bidIdList[i];
                    delete queue.idToBidMap[bidId];
                    queue.bidIdList.pop();

                    // Otherwise an underflow will occur
                    if (i == 0) {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                delete queue.numBids;
            }
        }

```
## Impact
The malicious user can block the `AuctionHouse::settle()` function which means that all of the users' funds will remain locked in the system and even if the user does not succeed with the attack and the `AuctionHouse::settle()` doesn't revert, the protocol will pay some extremely high gas fees

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
put some type of access control to the `EMPAM::decryptAndSortBids()` function, so only the seller can call it or limit the number of bids a user can make.
