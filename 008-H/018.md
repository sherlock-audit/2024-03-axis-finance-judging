# Bidders will not be able to claim bids

## Summary
If claimProceeds is called before all bidders have claimed their bids, some bidds will never be claimed.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability is that claimProceeds changes the state in the auctionData mapping to "Claimed":

And the claimBids requires the state to be "Settled" in order to be able to claim the bids:

## Impact
After calling claimProceeds, the`claimBids` function will revert, and bidders will not be paid.
