# Missing zero check of capacity in,  `Auction.sol::auction()`

## Summary

When an auction is `Atomic` meaning it is not prefunded a seller can set up  the auction params where capacity is `zero`.
This should revert, Their should be a check of minimum `capacity` to be sold.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Seller sets up `params` of his `auction` and sets up capacity to be zero.
2. The auction is created yet nothing is to be sold.


## Impact

This may mislead many `users` to try and `bid` but it will only `revert`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
add this code in   `Auction.sol` in function `auction()`

```javascript
    if (params_.capacity == 0) {
            revert Auction_InvalidParams();
        }
```
