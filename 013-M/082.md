# The TX of the AuctionHouse#`refundBid()` called by the bidders, who are not winner, would be DOSed - due to reaching a gas limit

## Summary
The TX of the AuctionHouse#`refundBid()` called by the bidders, who are **not** winner, would be DOSed - due to reaching a **gas limit** inside the **for-loop** of the EMPAM#`_refundBid()`. 

As a result, the bidded-funds (quote tokens) of the bidders, who are **not** winner of the batch auction (of the `lotId_`), would be locked forever in the AuctionHouse contract.


## Vulnerability Detail
When a bidder would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()` to bid, the AuctionModule#`bid()` would be called.
Then, the quote token would be transferred from the bidder to the AuctionHouse contract like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L348-L350
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L353-L357
```solidity
    function bid(
        BidParams memory params_,
        bytes calldata callbackData_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint64 bidId) {
        ...
        // Record the bid on the auction module
        // The module will determine if the bid is valid - minimum bid size, minimum price, auction status, etc
        bidId = _getModuleForId(params_.lotId).bid( ///<-------------- @audit
            params_.lotId, msg.sender, params_.referrer, params_.amount, params_.auctionData
        );

        // Transfer the quote token from the bidder 
        _collectPayment( ///<-------------- @audit
            params_.amount,
            lotRouting[params_.lotId].quoteToken,
            Transfer.decodePermit2Approval(params_.permit2Data)
        );
        ...
```

Within the AuctionModule#`bid()`, the EMPAM#`_bid()` would internally be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/Auction.sol#L460
```solidity
    function bid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        address bidder_,
        address referrer_,
        uint96 amount_,
        bytes calldata auctionData_
    ) external override onlyInternal returns (uint64 bidId) {
        // Standard validation
        _revertIfLotInvalid(lotId_);
        _revertIfBeforeLotStart(lotId_);
        _revertIfLotConcluded(lotId_);
        _revertIfLotSettled(lotId_);

        // Call implementation-specific logic
        return _bid(lotId_, bidder_, referrer_, amount_, auctionData_); ///<-------------- @audit
    }
```

Within the EMPAM#`_bid()`, the minimum bid amount (`minAmount`) would be calculated and a given bid amount (`_amount`) would be validated by using it.
Finally, a given `bidId` would be stored into the `auctionData` storage of the given `lotId_` (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`) like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol#L242-L247
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol#L264
```solidity
    function _bid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        address bidder_,
        address referrer_,
        uint96 amount_,
        bytes calldata auctionData_
    ) internal override returns (uint64 bidId) {
        ...
        // Amount must be at least the minimum bid size at the minimum price ///<----------- @audit 
        uint256 minAmount = Math.mulDivDown(
            uint256(auctionData[lotId_].minBidSize),
            uint256(auctionData[lotId_].minPrice),
            10 ** lotData[lotId_].baseTokenDecimals
        );
        if (amount_ < minAmount) revert Auction_AmountLessThanMinimum();ã€€///<----------- @audit
        ...

        // Store bid data
        bidId = auctionData[lotId_].nextBidId++;
        ...

        // Push bid ID to list of bids to decrypt
        auctionData[lotId_].bidIds.push(bidId); ///<------------------------------------- @audit 
        ...
```

When a bidder does not win the batch auction, the bidder would call the AuctionHouse#`refundBid()` to receive a refund  of their bidded-funds (quote tokens).

When a bidder, who is **not** winner, would call the AuctionHouse#`refundBid()`, the AuctionModule#`refundBid()` would internally be called.

Within the AuctionModule#`refundBid()`, the EMPAM#`_refundBid()` would internally be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/Auction.sol#L515
```solidity
    function refundBid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        uint64 bidId_,
        address caller_
    ) external override onlyInternal returns (uint96 refund) {
        // Standard validation
        _revertIfLotInvalid(lotId_);
        _revertIfBeforeLotStart(lotId_);
        _revertIfBidInvalid(lotId_, bidId_);
        _revertIfNotBidOwner(lotId_, bidId_, caller_);
        _revertIfBidClaimed(lotId_, bidId_);
        _revertIfLotConcluded(lotId_);

        // Call implementation-specific logic
        return _refundBid(lotId_, bidId_, caller_); ///<------------------------------------- @audit 
    }
```

Within the EMPAM#`_refundBid()`, the number of the `bidIds[i]` (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`) would be **looped** until it would match a given `bidId_`.
Once a `bidIds[i]` match a given `bidId_`, the `bidIds[i]` would be removed like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol#L293-L298
```solidity
    function _refundBid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        uint64 bidId_,
        address
    ) internal override returns (uint96 refund) {
        // Set bid status to claimed
        bids[lotId_][bidId_].status = BidStatus.Claimed;

        // Remove bid from list of bids to decrypt
        uint64[] storage bidIds = auctionData[lotId_].bidIds; ///<-------------------------- @audit 
        uint256 len = bidIds.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {  ///<-------------------------- @audit 
            if (bidIds[i] == bidId_) {    ///<-------------------------- @audit 
                bidIds[i] = bidIds[len - 1]; 
                bidIds.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
```
 
However, within the EMPAM#`_refundBid()`, there is no limit how many bids can be created for a given `lotId_` and there is no limit how many its bidIds can be stored into their `bidIds` array storage (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`).
 
If a malicious bidder would create **a lot of** bids for a given `lotId_` by calling the AuctionHouse#`bid()` multiple times, **so many** `bidId` would be stored into the `bidIds` array storage of the given `lotId_` (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`).

After that, if a bidder, who is **not** winner of the batch auction (of the `lotId_`), would call the EMPAM#`_refundBid()` via the AuctionHouse#`refundBid()` to receive the refund from the batch auction, their TX will be reverted - due to reaching a **gas limit** inside the **for-loop** of the EMPAM#`_refundBid()`. 

As a result, the bidded-funds (quote tokens) of the bidders, who are **not** winner of the batch auction (of the `lotId_`), would be locked forever in the AuctionHouse contract.


**NOTE:**
Even though the `minAmount` would be used in the EMPAM#`_bid()`, this is not enough. Because a large capital holder can do this attack. (Especially, in the case of that the `minAmount` set is **low** amount, this attack would be easier for a malicious actor to this attack. Because the cost of this attack is relatively **lower**)


## PoC
Let's say: 
- Alice is a seller (of this batch auction).
- Bob is a malicious bidder.
- Paul, Carol, Ken are victim bidders and they won't be winner of this batch auction.

An attack scenario would be like this:
- 1/ Alice would call the EMPAM#`_auction()` via the Auctioneer#`auction()` with a **small** amount of the `minPrice` (`auctionData[lotId_].minPrice`) and the `minBidSize` (`auctionData[lotId_].minBidSize`).
- 2/ Bob would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()` **100 times** with the **minimum amount** of a bid (`minPrice` * `minBidSize`) respectively.
- 3/ Paul would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()`. 
- 4/ Carol would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()`. 
- 5/ Ken would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()`. 
- 6/ Alice would call the AuctionHouse#`settle()`.
- 7/  Since Paul, Carol, Ken were **not** selected as a winner, they would call the EMPAM#`_refundBid()` via the AuctionHouse#`refundBId()` respectively.
- 8/ However, the TX of the step 7/ above would be reverted - due to reaching a **gas limit** inside the **for-loop** of the EMPAM#`_refundBid()`. 
   - This reason is that a lot of bid IDs are stored in the `bidIds` array storage (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`) - when the step 2/. And the **for-loop** would be started from the `bidId`, which was earlier to be stored into the `bidIds` array storage (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`). Hence, the bidId of Paul, Carol, Ken would match to refund at least 101 th in the for-loop. As a result, their TX would be reverted - due to reaching a **gas limit** inside the **for-loop** of the EMPAM#`_refundBid()`. 

In this scenario, any normal bidder, who would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()` after Bob would call the AuctionHouse#`bid()` **100 times**, will **not** be able to receive a refund of their bidded-funds (quote tokens). 
As a result, these victim bidder's bidded-funds (quote tokens) would be locked inside the AuctionHouse contract forever.


## Impact
The bidded-funds (quote tokens) of the bidders, who are **not** winner of the batch auction (of the `lotId_`), would be locked forever in the AuctionHouse contract.

As a result, the bidders, who are **not** winner of the batch auction (of the `lotId_`), will lost their bidded-funds (quote tokens).

## Recommendation
When a batch auction, consider setting the limit how many bids can be created for a single `lotId_` and how many its bidIds can be stored into their `bidIds` array storage (`auctionData[lotId_].bidIds`).
