# DoS for EMPAM `refundBid`

## Summary

DoS for EMPAM `refundBid` function when the number of bids is large.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `refundBid` function in the `EMPAM` contract has a complexity of O(n) where n is the number of bids. This can be exploited to perform a DoS attack by creating a large number of bids and calling the `refundBid` function. The function will iterate over all the bids to find the bids to refund, which will consume a large amount of gas and cause the transaction to revert.

## Impact

Users will not be able to request a refund for their bids.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol#L295-L301

## Proof of concept

Add the following code to the contract `EmpaModuleRefundBidTest` in `refundBid.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt test_refundBidOog`.

```solidity
function test_refundBidOog() givenLotIsCreated givenLotHasStarted external {
    uint256 numBids = 56_000;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numBids; i++) {
        _createBid(_BIDDER, 2e18, 100e18);
    }

    vm.prank(address(_auctionHouse));
    uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
    _module.refundBid(_lotId, uint64(numBids), _BIDDER);

    assert(gasBefore - gasleft() > 30_000_000);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a search of bids with O(1) complexity for the refund function.
