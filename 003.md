# Missing check for module existence before installation of new module

## Summary
The `installModule()` function handles the installation of a `new module` into the system. 
According to Natspec:
```solidity
/// @dev        This function reverts if:
/// @dev        - The module (or other versions) is already installed
```
However, it does not include a direct check to ensure that the module is not already installed before proceeding with the installation.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Overwriting Existing Modules: 
Without a check to see if a module is already installed, the function could overwrite an existing module with a new version. This could lead to loss of functionality or data associated with the previous version of the module, as the new installation might not be fully compatible or might not include all the features of the previous version.

## Impact
 This omission could allow for the installation of a module that is already installed, potentially leading to overwrites or updates in an unauthorized manner.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an explicit check to ensure that the module is not already installed:
```solidity
require(!_moduleIsInstalled(keycode_))
```
