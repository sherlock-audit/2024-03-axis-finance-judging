# Inequitable Settlement Due to Unhandled Capacity Thresholds

## Summary
The auction contract cannot handle edge cases where the auction's capacity is barely met or just exceeded, potentially leading to an inequitable settlement.

## Vulnerability Detail
 
Current Implementation: The contract calculates the settlement based on the total capacity and the bids' contribution to filling it.

What Goes Wrong: `If the auction's capacity is barely met or slightly exceeded, especially by multiple bids at the marginal price, the settlement logic cannot distribute funds equitably among the winning bidders.`
```solidity
function _getLotMarginalPrice(uint96 lotId_)
    internal
    returns (MarginalPriceResult memory result)
{
    // ... existing code ...
       // If total capacity expended is greater than or equal to the capacity, we have found the marginal price
       // If capacity expended is strictly greater than capacity, then we have a partially filled bid
    // @audit  
    if (result.capacityExpended >= capacity) {
        result.marginalPrice = price;
        result.marginalBidId = bidId;
        if (result.capacityExpended > capacity) {
            result.partialFillBidId = bidId;
        }
        break;
    }

    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit No explicit logic for handling edge cases around capacity thresholds
}
```


## Impact
Potential misallocation of funds due to not properly handling bids around the capacity threshold, affecting the fairness of the auction.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Capacity Handling Logic: Refine the logic in `_getLotMarginalPrice` and `_settle` to explicitly handle cases where capacity is barely met or just exceeded.
