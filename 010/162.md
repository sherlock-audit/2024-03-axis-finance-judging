# Settlement Inaccuracy Due to Incorrect Bid Order Processing

## Summary
The settlement process in the auction contract may yield an inaccurate distribution of funds if the bid order is processed incorrectly, due to the lack of explicit handling for bid sorting errors.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The contract relies on the correctness of the bid order in the `decryptedBids` queue during the settlement process.
What Goes Wrong: `If the bid order is incorrect due to a sorting error or data corruption, the resulting settlement may unfairly favor certain bids over others.`

```solidity
function _settle(uint96 lotId_)
    internal
    override
    returns (Settlement memory settlement_, bytes memory auctionOutput_)
{
    // ... existing code ...

    // Logic that relies on the bid order being correct
    Queue storage queue = decryptedBids[lotId_];
    while (queue.getNumBids() > 0) {
        uint64 bidId = queue.getMaxId();
        // ... more logic ...
    }

    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit No explicit checks for the correctness of the bid order
}
```

## Impact
An incorrect bid order can lead to a misallocation of funds, with some bidders receiving more or less than their fair share.
Perceived unfairness in the auction outcome can damage the protocol's reputation and deter future participation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a verification step to ensure the bid order is correct after decryption and before settlement.
