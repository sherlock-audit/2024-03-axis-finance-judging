# Compromised Auction Data Integrity Post-Settlement

## Summary
The auction contract not maintain the integrity of auction data following the settlement, which is crucial for historical accuracy and potential dispute resolution.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The contract performs settlement but does not include explicit mechanisms to ensure the integrity of auction data after this process.

What Goes Wrong: `Without proper data integrity checks, the auction data could be left in an inconsistent state, leading to difficulties in  resolving disputes.


```solidity
function _settle(uint96 lotId_)
    internal
    override
    returns (Settlement memory settlement_, bytes memory auctionOutput_)
{
    // ... existing code ...

    // @audit Settlement logic is executed, but post-settlement data integrity is not verified
    // Auction data may be modified during settlement without a mechanism to ensure its integrity

    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit No explicit post-settlement data integrity checks
}
```

## Impact
Inaccurate historical data could hinder the protocol's ability to review past auctions and make informed decisions.
In the event of a dispute, inconsistent auction data could complicate or prevent the resolution process, potentially leading to legal and financial repercussions.

## Recommendation
Implement measures to ensure the integrity of auction data post-settlement, such as checksums or snapshots.
