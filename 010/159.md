# Settlement Disruption Due to Multiple Partial Fills

## Summary
The `_settle` function does not explicitly handle the scenario where multiple bids could be partially filled at the marginal price, potentially leading to an incorrect settlement.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The settlement logic in `_settle` and `_getLotMarginalPrice` calculates payouts and refunds for bids when the auction's capacity is reached. It accounts for a single partial fill.

What Goes Wrong: `If multiple bids are eligible for partial fills, the current logic may not correctly calculate the amounts for each bidder, leading to an unfair or incorrect distribution of funds.`
```solidity
function _settle(uint96 lotId_)
    internal
    override
    returns (Settlement memory settlement_, bytes memory auctionOutput_)
{
    // ... existing code ...

    // @audit This is the vulnerable part where only one partial fill is considered
    if (result.partialFillBidId != 0) {
        // Logic for handling a single partial fill
        // ... more logic ...
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
```

## Impact
Incorrect fund distribution, leading to potential losses for bidders and damaging the auction's credibility.
Loss of trust in the auction mechanism due to perceived unfairness or errors in the settlement process.

## Code Snippet
as given above the issue is in `_settle`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Logic Revision: Update the `_settle` function to iterate over all bids at the marginal price and calculate partial fills accordingly.
