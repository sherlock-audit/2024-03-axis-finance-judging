# when a bidder calls `Refund`, and another bidder calls `refund` and frontruns  the first `bidder`, The first transaction will fail.

## Summary
When bidder calls refund, and another bidder calls refund later, and his transaction goes through, while the first bidder, transaction is pending. his transaction may fail. This is because when he called refund the len had encaspulated the second bidder, therefore when his transaction runs, the length of the array cached will be greater than the actual queue length.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. There are 10 bidders in `batch` auction
2. All of them call refund
3. since this how we refund by using a loop
```javascript
    
        uint256 len = bidIds.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {
            if (bidIds[i] == bidId_) {
                bidIds[i] = bidIds[len - 1];
                bidIds.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
```
when lets say the transaction of the first bidder to call refund is logged after a later  transaction, the transaction will revert, this is because length of the bidIds will have changed.

## Impact
Denial of service leading a bidder to not get his refund back

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we can use mappings, to avoid using a loop, can enums when refunding no other `Bidder` can enter.
