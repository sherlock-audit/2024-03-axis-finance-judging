# User Loses Funds Due Excess Fee Deduction

## Summary
When a bid is created the [_allocateQuoteFees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L835-L854) function calculates protocolFee and referrerFee from the quote token amount, on Claiming and settling a bid fees is again calculated from the quote Token. Causing loss of user funds since more fees is deducted than the expected one.
## Vulnerability Detail
* Lets say Alice deposits 100USDB from which a 5USDB fee is deducted on purchase. 
* When Alice created a bid her balance will be 95USDB since fees will be deducted from the quote token 
*  When Alice Claims the bid another 5USDB fees will be deducted.
*  When Alice wants to settle the bid another 5USDB will be deducted. 
*  Total Amount of fees deducted will be 15USDB whereas it should only be 5USDB.
## Impact
Users will lose part of the quote token amount due to bad fee calculation logic
