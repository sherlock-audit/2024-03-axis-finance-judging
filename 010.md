# Funds can be stuck in a contract if a bid is submitted by a USDC/USDT bidder who is blacklisted.

## Summary

USDC/USDT tokens have implemented an administratively owned blocklist feature effectively restricting users from transmitting or acquiring funds. This is important to consider as these tokens are not specifically constrained for the protocol such as fee on transfer/deflationary/rebase tokens (clarified in the Context Q&A), hence it is assumed as a potential issue for the auctions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Note that https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#tokens-with-blocklists shows that:

Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

The following scenario describes the problem:

1. Bidder submits a bid while not included in the token blacklist. 
2. Subsequently, after placing the bid, Bidder is added to the token blacklist. 
3. Bidder cancels the bid and triggers a refund; however the refund transaction fails due to Bidder's inclusion in the blacklist, impeding the transfer of tokens back. 

or directly:

A blacklisted USDC user place a bid. When auction is finished it reverts as the blacklisted user transfer is forbidden. The bid will be stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L340-L373 // For ex. bid function does not validate if bid is valid with blacklisted tokens, moreover, 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L160-L186
// auction function currently checks if base token and quote token are non zero address and if the base token or quote token decimals are not within the required range. There is no validation regarding tokens with blocklist present. 

## Impact

Due to the lack of verification for the bidders presence on the blocklist, the contract might be unable to distribute funds. This translates on bidders not able to cancel a bid effectively and potentially their funds being stuck. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution to address this vulnerability is to implement a validation, (possibly within the refundBid() and claimBid() functions), specifically verifying whether the bidder is not blacklisted before returning the funds. 

Another possibility relies on handling this special token directly within the bid() function, for example implementing specific logic determining if the bid is correct while checking if the token for the bid uses a blocklist, then the bid might be invalid (depending on how the protocol team would handle this blocklisted tokens):

```solidity
 // The module will determine if the bid is valid - minimum bid size, minimum price, auction status, etc
        bidId = _getModuleForId(params_.lotId).bid(
            params_.lotId, msg.sender, params_.referrer, params_.amount, params_.auctionData
        );
```

Alternatively in `claimBids` and `refundBids` functions consider adding a try catch block for the transfer call.
