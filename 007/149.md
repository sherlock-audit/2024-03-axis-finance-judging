# Blacklisted address could break settlement

## Summary
If a bidder address gets blacklisted on the quoteToken (eg USDC) and is selected during settlement for partial fill, it will revert the settlement during transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `settle()` function  in Batch auctions calculations have a condition where a certain bid is partially filled for a certain `bidId`. This is the only case where `settle()` transfers some baseToken to a bidder.

Inside `settle()` we find: 
```solidity
           if (settlement.pfBidder != address(0)) {
                [...]
                Transfer.transfer(
                    routing.quoteToken, settlement.pfBidder, settlement.pfRefund, false
                );
                _sendPayout(settlement.pfBidder, settlement.pfPayout, routing, auctionOutput);
            }
```
In case this transfer reverts due to `pfBidder` being blacklisted, the entire `settle()` reverts.
## Impact
As the batch auctions need to be prefunded in such a condition all bids and seller's funding are locked in the contract. 

The probability of this event is low, as the following needs to happen:
1. the bidder must end up on the blacklist after creating the bid
2. the bid must be selected for the partial fill, but this cannot be predicted as the bids are encrypted.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the partial fill address payout from settlement to `claimBids()`.
