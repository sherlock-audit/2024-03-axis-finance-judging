# A malicious user may manipulate the price of an auction to buy an item below market value.

## Summary
A malicious user may manipulate the price of an auction to buy an item below market value.
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious user has the ability to refund his bid at any moment during the auction even if he is the highest bidder.
This introduces an attack that allows him to manipulate the price of an auction to buy an item for cheap.

we can observe the lack of highest bidder validation below
```solidity
    function refundBid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        uint64 bidId_,
        address caller_
    ) external override onlyInternal returns (uint96 refund) {
        // Standard validation
        _revertIfLotInvalid(lotId_);
        _revertIfBeforeLotStart(lotId_);
        _revertIfBidInvalid(lotId_, bidId_);
        _revertIfNotBidOwner(lotId_, bidId_, caller_);
        _revertIfBidClaimed(lotId_, bidId_);
        _revertIfLotConcluded(lotId_);

        // Call implementation-specific logic
        return _refundBid(lotId_, bidId_, caller_);
    }
```

## POC
the malicious user can achieve the above by the following

1. malicious user has 2 accounts
2. malicious user submits lowest possible bid first in the auction with 1st account
3. the malicious user then uses 2nd account to bid extremely high so that no other bidder would want to or make sense to bid higher.
4. the malicious bidder waits till the very last block before the conclusion of the auction.
5. the bidder refunds his large bid
6. his small bid is now the winner of the auction.
## Impact
malicious user can manipulate the price of an auction lower, this will be loss of funds for the seller, and a complete disruption of the intended protocol functionality
