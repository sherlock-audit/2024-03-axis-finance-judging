# Non-blast rebase tokens won’t work with the contract [LinearVesting]

## Summary
Protocol and referrer fee is not set upon deployment

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract: AuctionHouse.sol

Upon contract deployment, not the protocol, nor the referrer fee is set. This is only settable later within the setFee function.

Therefore, users can potentially create auctions and trade without a fee (until it is set).

This issue is rather classical than unique but can have a significant impact. It is a trivial example of “not set upon deployment”.

a) Lack of fee collection
