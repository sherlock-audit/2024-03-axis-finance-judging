# DOS in claiming of Bids

## Summary
When claiming bids from the auction module in the [claimBids](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L403-L448) function the protocol iterates through the bidClaims Length array and handles each of them. Since the protocol does not have a upper bound for bids claim length it will be more expensive to iterate through them resulting in gas cost which is more than block gas limit leading to a DOS state.
## Vulnerability Detail
When iterating through the array of bid Claims length below,it will be expensive if the length grows when there are more bids making it costly,resulting in gas cost above block gas limit leading to a DOS state.
```@solidity
   // Iterate through the bid claims and handle each one
        uint256 bidClaimsLen = bidClaims.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < bidClaimsLen; i++) {
         Auction.BidClaim memory bidClaim = bidClaims[i];


```
## Impact
Payouts will not be able to be sent on Claim

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have a upper bound on bid claims length to avoid iterating over long array that can reach out of gas limit
