# curator can't get fee

## Summary

The seller can not give the approval permission to the auctionHouse contract, causing the curator call to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The curator must first call the `curate` function to obtain the fee, but if the seller does not grant the AuctionHouse contract approve permission, the curate call will fail.

Because curate transfers tokens through transferFrom, this requires approval from the seller.
