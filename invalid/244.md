# Unsafe Casting May Lead to Overflow in calculateQuoteFees

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/FeeManager.sol#L68-L88
## Summary
The calculateQuoteFees function contains a vulnerability related to unsafe casting, which can lead to overflow. This issue arises from the use of uint96 data types and can impact the accuracy of fee calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the following aspects of the function which performs and arithmethic operation that might overflow above uint96,    after which is the casted unsafely back to uint96
in this function amount is multiplied by protocolfee + referer fee, which might cause an overflow, casting unsafely back to uint96 can lead to incorrect fee calculations
```solidity
function calculateQuoteFees(
        uint96 protocolFee_,
        uint96 referrerFee_,
        bool hasReferrer_,
        uint96 amount_
    ) public pure returns (uint96 toReferrer, uint96 toProtocol) {
        uint96 feeDecimals = uint96(_FEE_DECIMALS);

        if (hasReferrer_) {
            // In this case we need to:
            // 1. Calculate referrer fee
            // 2. Calculate protocol fee as the total expected fee amount minus the referrer fee
            //    to avoid issues with rounding from separate fee calculations
            toReferrer = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, referrerFee_, feeDecimals));
            toProtocol = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, protocolFee_ + referrerFee_, feeDecimals))
                - toReferrer;
        } else {
            // If there is no referrer, the protocol gets the entire fee
            toProtocol = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, protocolFee_ + referrerFee_, feeDecimals));
        }
    }
```

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function calculateQuoteFees(
        uint96 protocolFee_,
        uint96 referrerFee_,
        bool hasReferrer_,
        uint96 amount_
    ) public pure returns (uint96 toReferrer, uint96 toProtocol) {
        uint96 feeDecimals = uint96(_FEE_DECIMALS);

        if (hasReferrer_) {
            // In this case we need to:
            // 1. Calculate referrer fee
            // 2. Calculate protocol fee as the total expected fee amount minus the referrer fee
            //    to avoid issues with rounding from separate fee calculations
            toReferrer = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, referrerFee_, feeDecimals));
            toProtocol = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, protocolFee_ + referrerFee_, feeDecimals))
                - toReferrer;
        } else {
            // If there is no referrer, the protocol gets the entire fee
            toProtocol = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, protocolFee_ + referrerFee_, feeDecimals));
        }
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue:

Use safe arithmetic libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeMath) to handle overflow and underflow.
