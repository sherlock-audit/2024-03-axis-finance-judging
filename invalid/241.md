# DoS can be implemented via blacklisted ERC

## Summary
Malicious user can DoS via passing blacklisted token + curator/referrer address. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In Axis user can pass arbitrary token address. Addresses of curator/referrer also provides by user. Malicious actor can create EMPAM with token that has blacklist functionality. That can affect all functionality with transfers to curator/referrer. 

For example, in function `settle` there is no possible to settle auction because `_sendPayout(feeData.curator, curatorFeePayout, routing, auctionOutput)` will revert. 

Malicious actor can create many lots with attractive prices and bidders will lock their liquidity for lots that will never completed successfully. 

## Impact
High. Users will wait for something that will never happen.

```solidity
function settle(uint96 lotId_) external override nonReentrant {
        // Validation
        _isLotValid(lotId_);

...
                // Send refund and payout to the bidder
                Transfer.transfer(
                    routing.quoteToken, settlement.pfBidder, settlement.pfRefund, false
                );
                _sendPayout(settlement.pfBidder, settlement.pfPayout, routing, auctionOutput);
            }
...
            // Reduce funding by curator fee and send, if applicable
            if (curatorFeePayout > 0) {
                unchecked {
                    routing.funding -= curatorFeePayout;
                }
                _sendPayout(feeData.curator, curatorFeePayout, routing, auctionOutput);
            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider check that curator is not in blacklisted. Or implement transfer function to curator via separate funciton.
