# The protocol allows risk free bids

## Summary
The protocol allows risk free bids
## Vulnerability Detail
When we refund bid, there is no check that the bid we are refunding is the highest bid. This means that a malicious user may inflate the price without intent to actually purchase. This will cause users who do intend on purchasing to pay more than they should according to the fair market value.
```solidity
    function refundBid(
        uint96 lotId_,
        uint64 bidId_,
        address caller_
    ) external override onlyInternal returns (uint96 refund) {
        // Standard validation
        _revertIfLotInvalid(lotId_);
        _revertIfBeforeLotStart(lotId_);
        _revertIfBidInvalid(lotId_, bidId_);
        _revertIfNotBidOwner(lotId_, bidId_, caller_);
        _revertIfBidClaimed(lotId_, bidId_);
        _revertIfLotConcluded(lotId_);

        // Call implementation-specific logic
        return _refundBid(lotId_, bidId_, caller_);
    }
```
observing above, there is a lack of validation that the bid to be refunded is the highest bid.

## POC
alice = malicious user
bob = normal user
bob really wants the item up for bid
alice does may be the seller or just wants to maliciously inflate the price of the auctioned item

1. bob bids and is the highest bidder, no other legit bidder is willing to bid above him
2. alice submits bid and becomes highest bidder
3. bob is forced to bid higher for the item if he wants to, he does
4. alice bids higher
5. alice can continue to outbid bob even if she does not want the item, she has no risk because she can just refund the bid at the last possible second
6. bob thinking the market value is higher than usual, is subjugated to bidding higher against a bidder who does not intend to purchase the item
## Impact
A malicious user can inflate the bid of an auction because she can refund her bid at any moment
