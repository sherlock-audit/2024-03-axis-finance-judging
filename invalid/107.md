# Unbounded loop can prevent auction settlement

## Summary
EMPA settlement processes all bids at once, if there are enough bids, the price of gas processing them may be greater than block gas limit, which prevents such transaction being mined.

## Vulnerability Detail
`EncryptedMarginalPriceAuctionModule._settle()` call includes two unbounded loops.
First and expensive one is in `_getLotMarginalPrice()`
```solidity
moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol
611     for (uint256 i = 0; i < numBids; i++) {
```
and second smaller cheaper is 
```solidity
moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol
772    for (uint256 i = remainingBids - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
```

Some auction lots may have a lot of bids, maybe naturally maybe some griefer just spammed a lot of bids with minimum price.
If there are enough bids, gas cost to execute transaction may be higher than gas limit for a block, that is why such transaction will not be mined.


## Impact
Bidders cannot refund because the auction is concluded.
All bidders and seller will have their funds locked.

## Recommendation
Just like you decrypt bids in chunks, implement settlement in chunks too.
