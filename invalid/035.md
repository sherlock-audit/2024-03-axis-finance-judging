# The function `claimbids()` may be invoked after a very prolonged time prior settlement, thereby inducing an accumulation of "debt" within the protocol

## Summary

A user/participant may delay considerable time to invoke claimBids() after a batch auction has settled. While this is not a lending protocol it might appear as the contract has accumulated, debt if these bids are not given back after a specific period. 

## Vulnerability Detail

As per the protocol documentation, users are required to manually execute transactions for bidding, canceling bids, and claiming refunds if they are unsuccessful in winning auctions. The issue arises with claiming bids, as neither the function itself nor the documentation specifies any time constraints for when this function should be call (after settlement) making the protocol look as it has accumulated debt. 

Consider the following POC:

1.- The auction has concluded, and the claimBids() function has been invoked following a lapse of one year (worst case scenario). Its validity persists as no temporal restrictions or provisions for cessation or reversal of this function have been delineated even after a prolonged duration. It is assumed by the protocol that `claimBids()` will be called immediately after settlement.

        vm.warp(365 days);
        _auctionHouse.claimBids(_lotId, _bidIds);

        // Check the accrued fees
        _assertAccruedFees();
        _assertQuoteTokenBalances();
        _assertBaseTokenBalances();
}

## Impact

In accordance with the PoC, the protocol is liable to accrue unnecessary debt if claimBids is not invoked right after settlement and delays considerable time, as the funds in question are the rightful property of the participants and are not at the disposal of the protocol. This also results in a reduction of the auction's value, as it cannot be fully concluded until those funds are returned.

The impact could worsen, as per the developers' explanation that when claiming bids, the intention is to encourage "sponsor" bid claiming to reduce gas costs for bidders. However, this approach might lead to further delays in the function's execution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol should consider incorporating a reasonable timeframe for the claiming of bids. Upon expiration of this timeframe, automatic refunding of the user, accompanied by a nominal fee, or the appropriation of a percentage of the bid to the protocol could be considered. Alternatively, an automated initiation of claim bid payouts subsequent to the settlement of a batch auction looks like another viable solution.

In general, auction settlement should be implementing time constraints as the auction data.
