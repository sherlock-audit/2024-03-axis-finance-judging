# Auction creator can prevent curator fee via revoking approval or insufficient tokens in the wallet

## Summary

Auction creator can prevent curator fee via revoking approval or insufficient tokens in the wallet

## Vulnerability Detail

Contract: AuctionHouse.sol

The curator plays an important role in the protocol and is responsible for certain activities that can boost a sale, these could be marketing interactions, listing on third parties or vouching. 

Now we need to understand on which occasions and under what conditions a curate fee is applied:

a) FeeData.curated must be true
b) FeeData.curatorFee must be set

Once these both conditions are fulfilled, a curator fee is applied upon:

a) purchase
-> [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L247)

b) settle
-> [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L496](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L496)


Now we need to understand that these conditions will be only fulfilled after the curate function has been called by the curator on the corresponding auction:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L651](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L651)

The problem is that the curate function executes a transferFrom on the seller’s behalf:


Transfer.transferFrom(routing.baseToken, routing.seller, address(this), curatorFeePayout, false)

The seller can however simply revoke the approval or not have any tokens available, which would result in a revert of the curate function, this will then not mark the auction as curated and the curatorFee will remain zero.

The curator could however have already provided services and will then remain unpaid.

## Impact

IMPACT:

a) Prevention of curator fee payout
b) DoS of important basic functionality

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider transferring the curator fee in, whenever the auction is created and only execute a potential refund if the amount is unused/excessively covers the fee. 

The curatorFee should simply be “capacity * curatorFee” and curatorFee should be made immutable.
