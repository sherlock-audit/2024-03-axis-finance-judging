# Protocol Fee Changes Impacting Auction Settlements

## Summary
 The `AuctionHouse` contract is vulnerable to unexpected financial outcomes due to protocol fee changes during an active auction. Sellers and buyers could receive different amounts than anticipated if fees are altered before the auction's conclusion.

## Vulnerability Detail
 - Current Implementation: The contract calculates fees during the settle function based on the current fee settings.

- What Goes Wrong: `If protocol fees are updated after bids are placed but before the auction is settled, the final distribution of funds can differ from the expectations at the time of bidding.`
```solidity
// In the AuctionHouse contract
function settle(uint96 lotId_) external override nonReentrant {
    ...
    // @audit Fees are calculated here based on the current settings
    uint96 totalInLessFees;
    {
        (, uint96 toProtocol) = calculateQuoteFees(
            lotFees[lotId_].protocolFee, lotFees[lotId_].referrerFee, false, purchased_
        );
         unchecked {
        totalInLessFees = purchased_ - toProtocol;
     }
 }
...
}
```

## Impact
- leading to a potential loss of trust in the platform as users may receive less than expected due to fee changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- To mitigate this issue, protocol fees should be locked in at the time of bid placement or auction creation. This ensures consistency and predictability of fees for all parties involved.
-  When a bid is placed or an auction is created, the current protocol fee should be recorded and associated with that specific auction or bid.
- During settlement, the contract should use the recorded fee rather than the potentially updated global fee setting.

**Implementation**:
The `purchase` function already calculates fees at the time of the transaction, which is a one-time operation and not subject to changes in fees during an auction's lifecycle. This immediate fee deduction upon purchase should be mirrored in the auction settlement process to ensure consistency.
