# Lack of Authentication and Authorization during  Encryption and Decryption

## Summary
The lack of authentication and authorization in the  `ECIES` implementation poses a significant security risk, particularly in scenarios where the contract is interacted with by multiple parties. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Exploit Scenario: 
> Consider a scenario where the `ECIES` contract is deployed on the `Ethereum blockchain` and is intended to be used by a set of `authorized users to encrypt and decrypt messages`. Without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, an `attacker` could exploit the contract in the following way:

1. The `attacker` monitors the blockchain for transactions involving the `ECIES` contract. They can see when users are `encrypting` messages but do not have the `private keys` to `decrypt` them.
2. The `attacker` intercepts an `encrypted message` and its corresponding `public key`. They then use their own `private key` to `encrypt` a malicious message using the intercepted `public key`. Since the `ECIES` contract does not verify the identity of the `sender` or the `recipient`, the contract will accept this `encrypted` message as `valid`.
3. The `attacker` sends the `encrypted malicious message` to the intended `recipient`. Since the message was encrypted using the `recipient's public key`, the `recipient` can decrypt it using their ``private key`. The `recipient`, unaware of the attacker's actions, believes the message to be legitimate and may take action based on its contents.
4. If the `malicious message` contains sensitive information or instructions, the `attacker` could gain `unauthorized access` to resources or perform actions that they are not supposed to.

## Impact
Without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, unauthorized users could potentially perform actions they are not supposed to, leading to `data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security incidents`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Access Control: 
Implement access control lists (ACLs) or `role-based access control (RBAC)` to restrict who can call the `encryption and decryption` functions. This could be done using the `Ownable pattern from OpenZeppelin`, where only the `contract owner` or `specific addresses` can call certain functions.
