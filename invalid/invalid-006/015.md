# Governance can arbitrarily burn Tokens from any address

## Summary
Burning of balances from arbitrary addresses is a dangerous form of admin privilege.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a smart contract allows `owner` to `burn tokens` from `arbitrary addresses` without proper authorization or validation, it can lead to unauthorized token destruction.


## Impact
Risk of malicious/compromised governance burning user's token resulting in loss of funds for the users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the burn function so it only allows `msg.sender` to burn their own tokens:

```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount_) external {
    _burn(msg.sender, amount_);
}
```
