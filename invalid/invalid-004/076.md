# Loss of yield for USDB/WETH in Blast linear vesting contract

## Summary
The linear vesting contract accepts different collaterals to be used. In the case when the collateral used is USDB/WETH, accrued yield will be lost, as there is no way for protocol to claim these yield.

## Vulnerability Detail
Blast linear vesting inherits `BlastGas.sol` and sets the governor to the auction house contract. But this only allows the linear vesting contract to claim gas yield. It does not have any implementation to claim USDB/WETH yield.

## Impact
Loss of yield when USDB/WETH is used as collateral tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a way to set yield mode to CLAIMABLE, as well as a way to claim these yields.
