# Non-blast rebase tokens won’t work with the contract [AuctionHouse&LinearVesting]

## Summary

Non-blast rebase tokens won’t work with the contract

## Vulnerability Detail

Contracts:

- AuctionHouse.sol
- LinearVesting.sol



Currently, the docs state the following:

“See above. Rebasing tokens with strictly increasing token balances should work in the contract, but extra balances will be accrued by the contract. Rebasing tokens with decreasing token balances are not supported.”

While I highly assume that this is only in context with Blast’s WETH and USDB, this description is not strictly enough which means it won’t exclude other tokens. 

Therefore, it becomes a valid issue to mention that other rebase tokens than WETH/USDB (on Blast) are obviously not supported. 

I don’t really think a PoC is necessary here but if you need one you can just follow the auction creation path with the prefunded method. Let’s assume 100 “REBASE” are deposited in the contract, this will increase the “funding” parameter by 100 and set the capacity to 100. However, any balance increase is obviously not accounted for, these tokens will just sit in the contract and can never be withdrawn.

The same issue applies to the LinearVesting contract.

These funds are therefore permanently locked.

## Recommendation

Consider not using these tokens or implement a trusted governance function which allows for withdrawing any excess tokens.

An optional solution would be to implement a framework for internal accounting, which then exposes a public function that allows excess funds to be withdrawn to the protocol address (additionally with a small fee to incentivize callers). This would align with the protocol’s goal of trustlessness. It goes without saying that such an architecture needs to be rigorously audited.
