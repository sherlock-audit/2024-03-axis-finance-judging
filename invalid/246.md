# Atomic auctions suspicious of blockchain reorg attack

## Summary

Atomic auctions(in this case FPAM) might be vulnerable to blockchain reorg attacks on mainnet

## Vulnerability Detail

The `lotId` of auctions are determined by incrementing the `lotCounter`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L194
As an example :
A seller sends a transaction(transaction-A in Block-A)  that creates an auction and returns a `lotId`
A buyer then sends a purchase transaction (transaction-B in Block-B) using the `lotId`
due to a reorg the block-A is dropped , An attacker can front-run transaction-B to create an auction of an undesired/lower valued token

## Impact

Auction buyer could end up purchasing unwanted/valueless tokens

## Code Snippet

```sol
function purchase(
        PurchaseParams memory params_,
        bytes calldata callbackData_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint96 payoutAmount) {
        _isLotValid(params_.lotId);

// wait period assertion here before purchase logic

        // Load routing data for the lot
        Routing storage routing = lotRouting[params_.lotId];

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

inclusion of a wait period or number of elapsed blocks before auctions can be purchased
