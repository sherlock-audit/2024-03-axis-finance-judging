# `routing.funding` can silently underflow in AuctionHouse.claimBids()

## Summary
doing `routing.funding -= bidClaim.payout` can silently underflow `routing.funding`.

## Vulnerability Detail
in `AuctionHouse.claimBids()`  before `bidClaim.payout` is deducted from the remaining amount of base tokens in funding, there's no check to ensure `routing.funding` is indeed > `bidClaim.payout` and the deduction is done in `unchecked` block.
```solidity
                // Reduce funding by the payout amount
                unchecked {
                    routing.funding -= bidClaim.payout;//@audit-issue possible underflow
                }
```

So `routing.funding` can silently underflow whenever `bidClaim.payout` is > `routing.funding`

## Impact
`routing.funding` can underflow in AuctionHouse.claimBids() making it become extremely large
`routing.funding` will no longer reflect the actual funding value BUT the overinflated one
`routing.funding` will never finish /runout

## Recommendation

before `bidClaim.payout` is deducted from the remaining amount of base tokens in funding,  check to ensure `routing.funding` is indeed > `bidClaim.payout`
