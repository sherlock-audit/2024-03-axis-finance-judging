# Allocation of fees can be higher than 100%

## Summary

The amount of fees allocated to referrers and the protocol can be higher than the total amount of available quote tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `ActionHouse` the fee percentage for each type of fee [is limited to 1e5](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L706) (100%). However, it is not taken into account that the protocol fee and the referrer fee are both taken from the same amount, so the total fee can be greater than 100%. This can lead to different issues in the contract.

In some cases, this will result in an [underflow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L592-L594) that will cause the wrong amount to be transferred, most likely reverting the transaction and not allowing users to perform the intended action, like claiming the proceeds of an auction.

In other cases, more tokens than the total available balance of the contract can be [allocated to fee recipients](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L849-L850), which can result on other users not being able to claim their proceeds.

## Impact

The accounting of the fees will be broken, which can cause some operations not to be executable and users not to be able to claim their proceeds.

## Recommendation

```diff
    function setFee(Keycode auctionType_, FeeType type_, uint48 fee_) external override onlyOwner {
-       // Check that the fee is a valid percentage
-       if (fee_ > _FEE_DECIMALS) revert InvalidFee();
-
        // Set fee based on type
        // Or a combination of protocol and referrer fee since they are both in the quoteToken?
        if (type_ == FeeType.Protocol) {
+           if (fee_ + fees[auctionType_].referrer > _FEE_DECIMALS) revert InvalidFee();
            fees[auctionType_].protocol = fee_;
        } else if (type_ == FeeType.Referrer) {
+           if (fee_ + fees[auctionType_].protocol > _FEE_DECIMALS) revert InvalidFee();
            fees[auctionType_].referrer = fee_;
        } else if (type_ == FeeType.MaxCurator) {
+           if (fee_ > _FEE_DECIMALS) revert InvalidFee();
            fees[auctionType_].maxCuratorFee = fee_;
        }
    }
```
