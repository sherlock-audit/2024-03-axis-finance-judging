# User's will receive less than minAmountOut

## Summary
User's will receive less than minAmountOut

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to rounding (up for prices), a use can receive less than specified minAmountOut.
```solidity
        price = uint96(Math.mulDivUp(amountIn, baseScale_, qBid.minAmountOut));
```

### Example
Bid amount =   250000000000000000
minAmountOut =   500000000000000001
  actual recied amount = 500000000000000000

## Impact
Contracts interacting will expect exact amount but get less which can impact their operations
