# Solmate safetransfer and safetransferfrom does not check the code size of the token address, which may lead to funding loss

## Summary

The safetransfer and safetransferfrom functions don't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds, because if safetransfer() and safetransferfrom() are called on a token address that doesn't have a contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. 

Due to this protocol will think that funds have been transferred successfully, and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality, funds were never transferred. 

## Impact

This will lead to miscalculation in the AuctionHouse.sol contract and possibly loss of funds for users.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/lib/Transfer.sol#L49-L68

```solidity
    function transfer(
        ERC20 token_,
        address recipient_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bool validateBalance_
    ) public {
        uint256 balanceBefore;
        if (validateBalance_ == true) {
            balanceBefore = token_.balanceOf(recipient_);
        }

        // Transfer the quote token from the user
        // `safeTransferFrom()` will revert upon failure or the lack of allowance or balance
        token_.safeTransfer(recipient_, amount_);

        // Check that it is not a fee-on-transfer token
        if (validateBalance_ == true && token_.balanceOf(recipient_) < balanceBefore + amount_) {
            revert UnsupportedToken(address(token_));
        }
    }
```

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        ERC20 token_,
        address sender_,
        address recipient_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bool validateBalance_
    ) public {
        uint256 balanceBefore;
        if (validateBalance_ == true) {
            balanceBefore = token_.balanceOf(recipient_);
        }

        // Transfer the quote token from the user
        // `safeTransferFrom()` will revert upon failure or the lack of allowance or balance
        token_.safeTransferFrom(sender_, recipient_, amount_);

        // Check that it is not a fee-on-transfer token
        if (validateBalance_ == true && token_.balanceOf(recipient_) < balanceBefore + amount_) {
            revert UnsupportedToken(address(token_));
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation

Use openzeppelin's safeERC20 or implement a code existence check.
