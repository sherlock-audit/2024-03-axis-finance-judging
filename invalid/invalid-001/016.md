# `Auctioneer.sol::auction` is calling `Auctioneer.sol::_onCreateCallback` passing wrong argument

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`Auctioneer.sol::auction` is divided into two by an if statement in which the function verifies pre-funding. If `requiresPrefunding == true`, verifies if hasPermission. If it has, call `Auctioneer.sol::_onCreateCallback` passing the correct params. However, if hasPermission is false, the function takes the second path in which regular ERC20 transfer takes place. However, in this second path, `Auctioneer.sol::_onCreateCallback` receives `false` as the last argument instead of true, which this path requires.

## Impact
This creation with wrong parameters will initiate an auction pre-funded as it isn't. This behavior will lead to unexpected responses in several functions and locked pre-funding values.
