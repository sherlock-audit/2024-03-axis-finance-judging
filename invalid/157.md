# EMPAM#_getLotMarginalPrice has a potential DOS vulnerability

## Summary

The EMPAM#_getLotMarginalPrice internal function is susceptible to a DOS issue which can prevent funds from ever being settled.

## Vulnerability Detail

In some auctions, it may be the case that the number of bids are too high to be processed in one transaction, whether it being about decrypting them, calculating their marginal price or settling them. As such, we have to adopt mechanisms which partially processes each portion of the total bids in a transaction. We can see that it is implemented correctly in the EMPAM#_decryptAndSortBids internal function where in each transaction, only a number of bids are decrypted. 

However, in the EMPAM#_getLotMarginalPrice function, the for loop is configured to loop through all the bids at once ([Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker\src\modules\auctions\EMPAM.sol#L613-L613)). 

This could result in a out-of-gas revert when number of bids are high. It is perfectly possible to happen as there may be auctions with a high number of bids. 

## Impact

In case of a highly bidded auction, the marginal price will never be calculated because the transaction will run out of gas and therefore all bidders and the seller will lose their funds. 

## Code Snippet

There is only one needed code snippet : 

```solidity
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < numBids; i++) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the same mechanism which is used when decrypting bids. Calculate marginal price by processing a fixed number of bids in one transaction, and allow settling only after all the bids are processed.
