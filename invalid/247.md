# curator can lead to DOS `purchase()` function

## Summary
the `purchase()` in the `AuctionHouse.sol` sends `curator` fees directly which is problamatic if `curator` unable to receive funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
transfering curator fees directly in `purchase()` can lead to DOS this function. lets say seller sets base token to tokens that have blacklist like `USDT` and `USDC` and curator got blacklisted in base token. we can see that `purchase()` sends curator fees directly so in this scenario curator blocks whole `purchase()` function.  

```solidity
        if (curatorFeePayout > 0) {
            _sendPayout(lotFees[params_.lotId].curator, curatorFeePayout, routing, auctionOutput);
```

## Impact
the `purchase()` always revert if curator address is blacklisted in base token.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function purchase(
        PurchaseParams memory params_,
        bytes calldata callbackData_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint96 payoutAmount) {
        
.
.
.
.
        // Send curator fee to curator
        if (curatorFeePayout > 0) {
            _sendPayout(lotFees[params_.lotId].curator, curatorFeePayout, routing, auctionOutput);
        }

}

## Recommendation
implement `claimFees()` function for curators to claim their funds.
