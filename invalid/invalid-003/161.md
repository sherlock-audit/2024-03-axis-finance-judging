# Inaccurate Auction Outcome Due to Lack of Bid Decryption Validation

## Summary
The auction contract assumes all decrypted bids are correct, potentially leading to an inaccurate auction outcome if a bid is decrypted incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The contract decrypts bids and assumes the resulting values are correct without additional validation checks.

What Goes Wrong: `If a bid is decrypted to an incorrect value due to encryption errors or data corruption, it could be incorrectly included or excluded from the auction outcome.`
```solidity
function _decryptAndSortBids(uint96 lotId_, uint64 num_) internal {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Decrypt the bid
    uint96 amountOut;
    {
        uint256 result = _decrypt(lotId_, bidId, lotBidData.privateKey);

        // Only set the amount out if it is less than or equal to the maximum value of a uint96
        if (result <= type(uint96).max) {
            amountOut = uint96(result);
        }
    }

    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit  No additional validation after decryption
}
```

## Impact
Incorrect inclusion or exclusion of bids due to decryption errors could lead to financial loss for bidders or the auctioneer.

## Code Snippet
As discussed above that the issue is Due to Lack of Bid Decryption Validation in function `_decryptAndSortBids`

## Recommendation
-  Implement a validation mechanism to ensure decrypted bid values are within expected ranges and conditions.
- Error Handling: Introduce error handling for cases where bid decryption yields improbable or incorrect values.
