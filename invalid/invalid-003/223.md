# Inadequate Handling of Lot Cancellation Post-Partial Settlement

## Summary 
The `AuctionHouse` contract not properly manage the cancellation of lots after a partial settlement, potentially resulting in the loss of funds for bidders or the seller.

## Vulnerability Detail 
- Current Implementation: The contract includes settlement logic but does not detail the handling of lot cancellations after partial settlements.
- What Goes Wrong: `If a lot is canceled after being partially settled, without clear logic to handle such cases, it could lead to improper refunds or failure to return funds.`

```solidity
// In the AuctionHouse contract
function settle(uint96 lotId_) external override nonReentrant {
    ...
    // Settlement logic here
    ...
}

// @audit Hypothetical cancellation logic (not present in code)
function cancelLot(uint96 lotId_) external {
    ...
    // Cancellation logic should handle refunds and returns here
    ...
}

```

## Impact
Bidders may not receive due refunds, and sellers might not get back the unsold portion of their assets.
