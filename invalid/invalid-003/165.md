# Settlement Discrepancies Due to Unaccounted Bid Refunds

## Summary
The auction contract's settlement process does not account for the impact of bid refunds on the total amount in, potentially leading to discrepancies in the final settlement outcome.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation: The contract aggregates bid amounts for settlement without considering the potential impact of bid refunds that may occur during the process.

What Goes Wrong: `If bids are refunded during settlement due to cancellation or other reasons, the total amount in may be inaccurately represented, affecting the settlement calculations.`

```solidity
function _refundBid(
    uint96 lotId_,
    uint64 bidId_,
    address
) internal override returns (uint96 refund) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // @audit Bid is marked as claimed, but the impact on the total amount in is not addressed
    bids[lotId_][bidId_].status = BidStatus.Claimed;

    // ... existing code ...
    // @audit No adjustment to the total amount in after a bid refund
}
```

## Impact
Overstatement of the total amount in could lead to an overestimation of the auction's proceeds, affecting the distribution of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `_settle` function to dynamically adjust the total amount in as bids are refunded.
Implement real-time tracking of the total amount in, updating it whenever a bid is refunded.
