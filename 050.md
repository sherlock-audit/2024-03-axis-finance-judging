# Panic revert due to overflow when auction creation

## Summary
When user create auction via `AuctionHouse::auction()` he can pass both `uint48 start` and `uint48 duration` in `Auction.AuctionParams` argument. After it: `uint48 conclusion = start + duration` -> panic revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Try to add two `uint48` and save result into `uint48`, what lead to revert overflow if `sum > uint48`. 

## Impact
If user will want to set max duration, he will spend gas without understanding where is higher limit of timestamp. Or need use only UI-versions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding check like `(start + duration) <= type(uint48).max`.
