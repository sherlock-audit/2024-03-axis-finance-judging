# Denial of service by reaching gas Limit, Since we keep reading and updating storage in `MaxPriorityQueue.sol`

## Summary
When decryptAndSortBids is called in `EMPAM.sol`, there's a possibility of encountering an unexpected revert. This arises from how `MaxPriorityQueue.sol` operates: it repeatedly reads and updates `storage` for each bid. As the number of bids increases, `sorting` them becomes more resource-intensive and costly. In some cases, this could lead to hitting the `gas limit` and failing to complete the sorting process.

## Vulnerability Detail
Reading and updating  `storage` can be very expensive, or can reach the gas limit

## Impact 
The purpose of sorting `bids` can never occur, when gas limit is reached or can be very expensive to sort in Ethereum Mainnet.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can sort by using a different algorithm that doesn't invoke reading and updating storage each time.
