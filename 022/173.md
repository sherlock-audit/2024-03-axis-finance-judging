# Possible DoS when refunding a bid due to an OOG error.

## Summary
A bidder in an EMPAM auction has the ability to refund his bid if he wishes so. The problem is it is done in a loop and has the potential to DoS due to reaching the block gas limit.
## Vulnerability Detail
To refund a bid, a bidder must call `refundBid()` on the AuctionHouse, which will call the module-specific implementation.

[AuctionHouse.sol#L380-L396](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L380-L396)
```solidity
Transfer.transfer(
    lotRouting[lotId_].quoteToken,
    msg.sender,
    // Refund the bid on the auction module
    // The auction module is responsible for validating the bid and authorizing the caller
    _getModuleForId(lotId_).refundBid(lotId_, bidId_, msg.sender),
    false
);
```

[EMPAM.sol#L284-L305](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/modules/auctions/EMPAM.sol#L284-L305)
```solidity
function _refundBid(
    uint96 lotId_,
    uint64 bidId_,
    address
) internal override returns (uint96 refund) {
    // Set bid status to claimed
    bids[lotId_][bidId_].status = BidStatus.Claimed;
    // Remove bid from list of bids to decrypt
    uint64[] storage bidIds = auctionData[lotId_].bidIds;
    uint256 len = bidIds.length;
    for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {
        if (bidIds[i] == bidId_) {
            bidIds[i] = bidIds[len - 1];
            bidIds.pop();
            break;
        }
    }
    // Return the amount to be refunded
    return bids[lotId_][bidId_].amount;
}
```
As can be seen, `_refundBid()` iterates over an array of `bidIds` to decrypt, which can lead to DoS, if said array grows too large.
## Impact
DoS leading to an inability to refund a bid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's possible to avoid iterating over an array of `bidIds` entirely. When `_refundBid()` is called, it sets the `BidStatus` to `Claimed`, so there is no need to remove the `bidId` from an array, since the contract can simply check if a bid has been already claimed/refunded and skip it if so during a decryption process.
