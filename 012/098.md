# Some Bidders might be unable to claim their payout if Base token derivative expiry is too close to auction expiry

## Summary

In an `EMPAM` auction, when the base token payout is structured as a derivative token, there is a risk that some bidders may not be able to claim their payouts if the derivative expiry time is too close to the auction conclusion time.

## Vulnerability Detail

When opening an auction using the `auction` function, the seller is allowed to specify the base token payout to be in the form form of a derivative token, thus when winning bidders later claim their bids they will get minted derivative token that can be redeemed for base token instead of sending them directly the base token.

```solidity
function auction(
    RoutingParams calldata routing_,
    Auction.AuctionParams calldata params_,
    string calldata infoHash_
) external nonReentrant returns (uint96 lotId) {
    ...

    // Derivative
    if (fromKeycode(routing_.derivativeType) != bytes5("")) {
        // Load derivative module, this checks that it is installed.
        DerivativeModule derivativeModule = DerivativeModule(
            _getLatestModuleIfActive(routing_.derivativeType)
        );

        // Check that the module for the derivative type is valid
        // Call module validate function to validate implementation-specific data
        if (
            derivativeModule.TYPE() != Module.Type.Derivative ||
            !derivativeModule.validate(
                address(routing.baseToken),
                routing_.derivativeParams
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidParams();
        }

        // Store derivative information
        routing.derivativeReference = derivativeModule.VEECODE();
        routing.derivativeParams = routing_.derivativeParams;
        routing.wrapDerivative = routing_.wrapDerivative;
    }

    ...
}
```

Even though the `auction` function does validate that the derivative token parameters are correct by calling `derivativeModule.validate`, it doesn't check if the derivative expiry timestamp is after the auction conclusion timestamp and neither does `derivativeModule.validate`.

This leads to two scenarios where either bidders or both bidders and the seller may be unable to collect payments (either payouts or refunds) from the auction house contract.

**NOTE: this issue can impact both types of auction (ATOMIC & BATCH) but it could only cause fund loss in the case of a batch auction so we will only concentrate on that type in the below scenarios**

Let's analyse these scenarios (the derivative mentioned below is the `LinearVesting` derivative):

**1- Scenario 1: `derivative expiry = auction conclusion + delta` where `delta` is very small gap between the two expiry timestamps**

- For this scenario the seller did set the payout base token to be a derivative token with an expiry timestamps very close to the auction conclusion timestamps (`delta` could be few seconds or minutes).

- After bidders have submitted some bids and the auction ends, the process of settlement start, first by submitting the private key then decrypting all the bids and finally calling the `settle` function.

- If we suppose that the `delta` time was sufficient to go through all those steps, then the auction will settle correctly.

- Now the bidders must call the `claimBids` function to collect their payouts, but the `delta` time has now passed and so the derivative token has expired.

- So when bidders call `claimBids`, it will revert because it will try to send the base token payout (using `_sendPayout` function) through minting the derivative tokens but as it has expired the `LinearVesting.mint` function will revert (see `LinearVesting.mint` function in code snippet below).

- So bidder won't be able to claim their payout amounts after that and the base tokens reserved for them will remains stuck in the `AuctionHouse` contract.

- **NOTE: in this scenarios it's fair to assume that some bidders will be able to call `claimBids` function before derivative token expiry (`delta` duration elapses) but we can't be sure that all of them will be able to do so and thus there is a greater chance for some of them to lose their payouts especially if `delta` duration is really small**

**2- Scenario 2: derivative expiry is equal or before auction conclusion time (worst case)**

- For this scenario the seller did set the payout base token to be a derivative token with an expiry timestamp equal or before the auction conclusion timestamp (`delta` mentioned before could be now 0).

- In this case also after bidders have submitted some bids and the auction ends, we will go through the process of settlement, but because `derivative expiry <= auction conclusion` this process could not even be completed, as when the `settle` function is called it will try to send the base token payouts to the partially filled bidder or the curator or both of them using `_sendPayout` which will call `LinearVesting.mint` but this will revert as the derivative has already expired.

- So the `settle` call will revert resulting in the auction being unable to settle which will block the bidders from claiming their bids and also the sellers from claiming the auctions proceeds.

- This scenario is worst than the first because both the base tokens reserved for the bidders and the quote tokens reserved for the seller will be stuck in the `AuctionHouse` contract.

- **NOTE: This scenario wan't happen if the auction has no curator or partially filled bidder and the auction will be settled, seller will be able to claim proceeds but bidder won't be able to claim their bids as we're be in the same situation as the first scenario**

In both the aforementioned scenarios bidders or seller (or both) could end up losing there funds which will remain stuck in the `AuctionHouse` contract, and this all could happen because the derivative expiry timestamp not being reasonably far (a day for example) after the auction conclusion timestamp.

This issue could happen either intentionally (mistake from the seller) or through a deliberate act by a malicious seller (mostly in scenario 1) to cause harm to the bidders.

## Impact

In an `EMPAM` auction, if the base token payout is in the form of a derivative token with an expiry before or just after the auction conclusion, either bidders or both bidders and the seller might be unable to claim their payment, resulting in funds being lost and stuck forever in the `AuctionHouse` contract.

## Recommendation

To address this issue, when an auction is created and is using a derivative, the `auction` function must verify that the derivative expiry timestamp is reasonably after the auction conclusion timestamp (could be minimum of a day between them for example).
