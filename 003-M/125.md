# BlastAuctionHouse will not be able to interact with USDB and WETH due to incorrect addresses hardcoded

## Summary
`BlastAuctionHouse.sol` implements functionality intended for receiving and claiming WETH and USDB yield. However, the testnet addresses are hardcoded instead of the mainnet addresses. The contract will not be able to interact with USDB and WETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BlastAuctionHouse.sol` hardcodes addresses for WETH and USDB on blast, allowing for receiving and claiming yield for the respective tokens. However, the testnet addresses are hardcoded instead of the mainnet addresses.

`BlastAuctionHouse` [#L39-44]()
```javascript
    /// @notice    Address of the WETH contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023);

    /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022);
```

The mainnet addresses of the WETH and USDB contracts on Blast are `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004` and `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003`, respectively. Please visit https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/weth-yield for more information and to confirm the addresses. There are warnings included in the link provided to "Be careful hardcoding the testnet WETH address for contracts you intend to deploy to mainnet." and "Be careful hardcoding the testnet USDB address for contracts you intend to deploy to mainnet.".

## Impact
Blast auction house will not be able to interact with USDB and WETH.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the addresses of WETH and USDB from testnet to mainnet 

```diff
    /// @notice    Address of the WETH contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
-       IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023);
+       IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004);

    /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
-       IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022);
+       IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003);
```
