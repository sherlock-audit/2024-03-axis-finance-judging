# Wrong addresses are used in BlastHouse.sol

## Summary
The BlastHouse.sol contract uses wrong addresses Weth and Usdb to claim the yield for the WETH and USDB tokens . 
## Vulnerability Detail
BlastHouse.sol uses the addresses of Sepolia Testnet Weth and Usdb  contracts instead of Blast Mainnet ones . As we can see here : 
```solidity
    /// @notice    Blast contract for claiming gas fees
    IBlast internal constant _BLAST = IBlast(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000002);

    /// @notice    Address of the WETH contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023);    <@ audit

    /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022);   <@ audit
```
But it is clearly mentioned in the documentation of Blast on how to receive and claim Weth & Usdb yields in this reference article - https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/weth-yield#mainnet

Here we can see the addresses should have been = `The WETH address on mainnet is 0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004` && `The USDB address on Blast mainnet is 0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003` instead of the ones used in the BlastHouse.sol . 
## Impact
BlastHouse.sol contract will not be able to claim the yield due to wrong addresses causing loss of funds .
