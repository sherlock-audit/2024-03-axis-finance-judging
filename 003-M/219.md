# BlastAuctionHouse.sol uses the wrong address for USDB and WETH

## Summary
USDB and WETH addresses defined in `BlastAuctionHouse.sol` are testnet addresses 

## Vulnerability Detail
The constant _WETH and _USDB contain the address of an empty wallet, which doesn't contain any methods. As a result, all calls made to it will revert.

## Impact
USDB and WETH are totally unusable

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L38-L44

## Tool used
Manual Review, Blast docs

## Recommendation
Update addresses to point to the Blast Mainnet contracts
```javascript
  /// @notice    Address of the WETH contract on Blast
  IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
      IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000003);

  /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
  IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
      IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000004);
```
