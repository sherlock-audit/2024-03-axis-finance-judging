# Wrong addresses set for _WETH and _USDB will DoS BlastAuctionHouse deployment

## Summary

The hardcoded addresses for Blast’s WETH and USDB contracts are wrong (they are the testnet address instead of the mainnet address). 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BlastAuctionHouse.sol` contract defines Blast’s WETH and USDB addresses as constant addresses, hardcoding the following values:

```solidity
// BlastAuctionHouse.sol

contract BlastAuctionHouse is AuctionHouse {
    
    ...

    /// @notice    Address of the WETH contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023);

    /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022); 
        
    ...
```

The problem is that these addresses are Blast’s WETH and USDB [testnet addresses](https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/weth-yield#testnet), instead of the proper [mainnet addresses](https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/weth-yield#mainnet). The proper values for WETH and USDB on Blast’s mainnet are:

- WETH: `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004`
- USDB:  `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003`

## Impact

Medium. It won’t be possible to deploy Blast’s Auction House, given that the call to configure() on each tokens in BlastAuctionHouse’s constructor will always fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the correct addresses for the WETH and USDB tokens in the constructor:

```diff
// BlastAuctionHouse.sol

contract BlastAuctionHouse is AuctionHouse {
    // ========== STATE VARIABLES ========== //

    /// @notice    Blast contract for claiming gas fees
    IBlast internal constant _BLAST = IBlast(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000002);

    /// @notice    Address of the WETH contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
-        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023); 
+        IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004); 
    /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
-        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022);
+        IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003);

```
