# Incorrect hard coded variables for _WETH and _USDB will prevent deployment

## Summary
Incorrect hard coded variables for _WETH and _USDB will prevent deployment

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract: BlastAuctionHouse.sol

The BlastAuctionHouse was developed in an effort to support Blast’s unique features such as receiving a part of the spent gas fees and claiming accrued values of Blast’s rebasing tokens. While the gas logic is perfectly fine, there is a problem with the rebasing tokens:

Currently, the addresses for _WETH and _USDB are hard coded as follows:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L39](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L39)

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L43](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L43)

These are incorrect, as they are the TESTNET addresses. This issue will most probably have a large number of duplicates but likely the impact is not correctly described, which most probably makes my issue the only fully valid one. Many users will say that this will prevent the protocol from receiving the accrued tokens, which is most likely declared as high severity.

This is however not correct because the IERC20Rebasing interface expects a uint256 as return value (balanceOf) for the configure call within the constructor: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L24](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L24)

The problem is, the current proxy on these addresses seems to not have a correct implementation, this then means there will be no uint256 return value for the configure call:


[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L54)


and therefore the deployment reverts. Therefore, I assess this as medium severity since no funds are lost but the contract simply “won’t work”

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider following the official Blast DOCS: https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/weth-yield

and expose the correct addresses:

WETH = 0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004

USDB = 0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003
