# Concluded auction (FPAM) will result in permanently stuck funds

## Summary
Concluded auction (FPAM) will result in permanently stuck funds

## Vulnerability Detail
Contract: FPAM.sol

The FPAM module allows for the following interactions:

Create an auction
Cancel an auction (reverts if auction has concluded)
Purchase from an auction (only within the auction run time)
Curate an auction (must not be ended)

Due to a blunder in the FPAM flow, unsold funds will be permanently stuck. Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice creates a FPAM auction, which is prefunded, start is TS 10_000, duration is 10_000 seconds and current TS = 5_000

-> lot.start = 10 000
-> lot.conclusion = 20 000

The capacity is irrelevant for the PoC, it is just important that this lotId is prefunded.

2. Some time passes and the interaction with this lotId is not as expected, there is still a large capacity once the end approaches.

3. Finally, the TS is 20 001 and the capacity is still large. At this point, no further purchases are possible:

_revertIfLotInactive(lotId_);

-> this only works if TS < conclusion, therefore, no purchases are allowed:

Additionally, the auction cannot be canceled anymore:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/Auction.sol#L735

This means, there is absolutely no way to retrieve any unsold funds for FPAM auctions.


## Impact
IMPACT: 

a) Permanently locked/lost funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing functionality which allows the auction creator to claim any unsold funds after the auction has been concluded.
