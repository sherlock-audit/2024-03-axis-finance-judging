# Pre-funded `FPAM` auctions may lead seller to lose funds.

## Summary
Pre-funded `FPAM` auctions may lead seller to lose funds if the auctions still have capacity when the auctions end. As `FPAM` does not implement `_claimProceeds` function, and seller cannot get his remaining capacity back.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `purchase` function tansfers the sold tokens to purchaser. It the auction is pre-funded, and still have capacity when the auction ends, the remaing capacity cannot be refunded to seller. As the `FPAM` implements only the `_auction` and `_purchase` functions, and these two functions cannot refund remaining capacity to seller.
