# Unwithdrawable prefunded balances in Fixed Price Auctions

## Summary
In the Fixed Price Auction Module (FPAM) if an auction concludes with remaining funds due to it being prefunded, the current implementation prevents the owner from reclaiming those funds, effectively locking them within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [cancelAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/modules/Auction.sol#L354) function in the Auction.sol contract, which includes a check _revertIfLotConcluded to prevent the cancellation of a lot if the auction time has already concluded or if the lot's capacity has been set to zero. 
```solidity
    function _revertIfLotConcluded(uint96 lotId_) internal view virtual {
        // Beyond the conclusion time
        if (lotData[lotId_].conclusion < uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            revert Auction_MarketNotActive(lotId_);
        }
```


In a scenario where the FPAM auction is prefunded and not all funds are claimed by the end of the auction, the owner attempts to cancel the auction to retrieve the remaining funds. However, due to the time-based check, the transaction reverts, leaving the funds inaccessible.

## Impact
Loss of funds for auction owners, where any prefunded amount remaining after the auction's conclusion becomes irretrievable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a separate function allowing auction owners to withdraw remaining funds after the auction has concluded. This function should bypass the time-based restriction while ensuring only the rightful owner can access the funds.
