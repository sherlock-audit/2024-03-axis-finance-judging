# Callback Contract Failures Disrupting Auction Settlements

## Summary
The `AuctionHouse` contract is susceptible to disruptions in the auction settlement process due to potential failures or unexpected behavior in callback contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Current Implementation: The contract relies on external callback contracts for certain operations, such as `onPurchase, onBid, onCurate, and onClaimProceeds.`
- 
- What Goes Wrong: If a callback contract does not perform as expected (e.g., not transferring the correct token amount), it could disrupt the flow of the auction process.

```solidity
// In the AuctionHouse contract
function purchase(...) external override nonReentrant returns (uint96 payoutAmount) {
    ...
    Callbacks.onPurchase(
        routing.callbacks,
        params_.lotId,
        msg.sender,
        amountLessFees,
        payoutAmount + curatorFeePayout,
        false,
         callbackData_
     );
// Check that the callback transferred the expected amount of base tokens
if (routing.baseToken.balanceOf(address(this)) < balanceBefore + payoutAmount + curatorFeePayout) {
    revert InvalidCallback();
}
...

```



## Impact
Could lead to incorrect token balances or loss of funds if the callback does not transfer the expected amount.
Disrupt the auction process, preventing settlement or claiming of proceeds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement fallback mechanisms for when callbacks fail.
Add comprehensive validation checks before and after callback interactions.
**Implementation in Other Functions**:
- Callbacks are used in various functions like `purchase`, `bid`, `curate`, and `claimProceeds`. Consistent handling of callback failures across all these functions is crucial.
