# derivativeParams is unbounded

## Summary
A seller (auction setter) can create an FPAM auction that cannot be purchased.

## Vulnerability Detail
This may be a duplicate, but I submitted for clarity. This attack involves a different variable, carries a different intent and has lower severity.
Key assumptions are <ins>underlined</ins>.
#### Seller
In `Auctioneer#auction` there is a storage write for the `Routing` struct which is set by the seller (caller):

```solidity
    struct Routing {
        address seller; // 20 bytes
        uint96 funding; // 12 bytes
        ERC20 baseToken; // 20 bytes
        Veecode auctionReference; // 7 bytes
        ERC20 quoteToken; // 20 bytes
        ICallback callbacks; // 20 bytes
        Veecode derivativeReference; // 7 bytes
        bool wrapDerivative; // 1 byte
        bytes derivativeParams;
    }
```
#### Buyer
<ins>The variable `bytes derivativeParams` can include arbitrary values and is unbounded.</ins> Regardless of whether derivatives are involved, a storage load occurs at `AuctionHouse#purchase`:
```solidity 
Routing storage routing = lotRouting[params_.lotId];
```

It is possible for a seller to set `derivativeParams` such that it consumes an amount of gas just below the block gas limit for any protocol.
When a buyer calls `purchase`, <ins>this storage load combined with the callback may bring the transaction over the block gas limit</ins>. (for callback as an attack vector please refer to my other report 'Callback gas usage is not checked')

## Impact
DOS
- On Optimism/Mainnet: attempts to purchase will revert
- On Arbitrum: attempts to purchase will be stuck in the retry queue

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the amount of bytes used by `derivativeParams` before allowing the auction to start
