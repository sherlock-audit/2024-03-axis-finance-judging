# User's can save on fee by setting themselves as referrer

## Summary
User's can save on referrers fee by setting any address controlled by themselves as the referrer address. This will make the protocol loose the fees that they would gain otherwise

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently there are two fees: protocol fees and referrer fees. And the total fees is shared among these. So a total fee of x% will be surely captured from the user and will be divided across the protcol and referrer based on their percentage shares.

```solidity
    function calculateQuoteFees(
        uint96 protocolFee_,
        uint96 referrerFee_,
        bool hasReferrer_,
        uint96 amount_
    ) public pure returns (uint96 toReferrer, uint96 toProtocol) {
        uint96 feeDecimals = uint96(_FEE_DECIMALS);

        if (hasReferrer_) {
            // In this case we need to:
            // 1. Calculate referrer fee
            // 2. Calculate protocol fee as the total expected fee amount minus the referrer fee
            //    to avoid issues with rounding from separate fee calculations
            toReferrer = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, referrerFee_, feeDecimals));
            toProtocol = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, protocolFee_ + referrerFee_, feeDecimals))
                - toReferrer;
        } else {
            // If there is no referrer, the protocol gets the entire fee
            toProtocol = uint96(Math.mulDivDown(amount_, protocolFee_ + referrerFee_, feeDecimals));
        }
    }
```

But since there are no whitelists for the referrers, any user can be a referrer which allows the bidder to set their own address as the referrer in order to save on the fees paid.

## Impact

Protocol will loose deserved fees

## Code Snippet

fee is shared

## Recommendation

Capture referrer fees from the user instead of sharing with the protocol fees
