# User is able to acquire referrer's fee

## Summary
User could acquire referrer's fee, due to referrer's address given as an input in `AuctionHouse::purchase` doesn't get validated

## Vulnerability Detail
Here scenario:
1. Bob decides to execute `AuctionHouse::purchase` for potential profit
2. To increase his profit value he will execute the function on-chain by calling `AuctionHouse::purchase` with custom `params_` set as an input
```javascript
function purchase(
        PurchaseParams memory params_,
        bytes calldata callbackData_
...
```
3. In `params_` he will set his personal address to `referrer`'s property
```javascript
struct PurchaseParams {
        address recipient;
        address referrer;
        uint96 lotId;
        uint96 amount;
        uint96 minAmountOut;
        bytes auctionData;
        bytes permit2Data;
    }
```
4. After that `AuctionHouse::purchase` calls `AuctionHouse::_allocateQuoteFees` and the referrer's fee will be added to `FeeManager::rewards` at Bob's address
(Note that `AuctionHouse` inherits `FeeManager`)
```javascript
function _allocateQuoteFees(
        uint96 protocolFee_,
        uint96 referrerFee_,
        address referrer_,
        address seller_,
        ERC20 quoteToken_,
        uint96 amount_
    ) internal returns (uint96 totalFees) {
        // Calculate fees for purchase
        (uint96 toReferrer, uint96 toProtocol) = calculateQuoteFees(
            protocolFee_, referrerFee_, referrer_ != address(0) && referrer_ != seller_, amount_
        );

        // Update fee balances if non-zero
        if (toReferrer > 0) rewards[referrer_][quoteToken_] += uint256(toReferrer);
        if (toProtocol > 0) rewards[_protocol][quoteToken_] += uint256(toProtocol);

        return toReferrer + toProtocol;
    }
```
5. Bob executes `AuctionHouse::claimRewards` to acquire the fees
```javascript
function claimRewards(address token_) external nonReentrant {
        ERC20 token = ERC20(token_);
        uint256 amount = rewards[msg.sender][token];
        rewards[msg.sender][token] = 0; 

        // @info auctionHouse transfer token_ to msg.sender
        Transfer.transfer(token, msg.sender, amount, false);
    }
```

## Impact
User could stole referrer's fee

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement `AuctionHouse::approvedReferrers` mapping(address -> bool)
2. Add approveReferrer onlyOwner function to set new approved referrer addresses to true
3. Validate referrer's address before transfer the quote tokens to it
