# Private Key Exposure in `ECIES::encrypt` Function

## Summary
The `encrypt` function within the `ECIES` library does not inherently protect against the exposure of the private key during the encryption process, which could lead to the loss of funds if the key is also used for transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Current Implementation:
```solidity
function encrypt(
    uint256 message_,
    Point memory recipientPubKey_,
    uint256 privateKey_,
    uint256 salt_
) public view returns (uint256 ciphertext_, Point memory messagePubKey_) {
    // @audit ... (omitted for brevity)
}
```
- `What Goes Wrong: The function requires the sender's private key as an input, which, if exposed, especially through off-chain communication, could compromise the sender's assets.`

## Impact
- **Asset Loss**: If the private key is also used for transactions, an attacker could transfer funds out of the sender's account.
- **Compromised Security**: The exposure of the private key undermines the security of the entire encryption scheme.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerability arises from the requirement for the sender's private key as an input in the `encrypt` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- **Key Management**: Ensure that private keys are never exposed on-chain or through off-chain communication that is not secure.
- **Encryption Off-Chain**: Perform sensitive operations like key generation and message encryption off-chain in a secure environment.
