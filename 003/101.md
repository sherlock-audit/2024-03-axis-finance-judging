# Use of wrong contract address in `BlastAuctionHouse.sol` to claim gas fees refunds

## Summary
In `BlastAuctionHouse.sol` the contract is designed to claim gas refunds on mainnet, but the contract address for both `WETH` and `USB` are the addresses in the testnet not the mainnet addresses

## Vulnerability Detail
- The addresses used are on testnet `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023` this is the link to the contract on the testnet <link>https://testnet.blastscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023<link> the address to be use should be `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004` <link>https://blastscan.io/address/0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004<link>
- Also for `USDB` the address used is on testnet <link>https://testnet.blastscan.io/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022<link> while it should be mainnet <link>https://blastscan.io/address/0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003<link>

## Impact
The transaction of trying to claim gas fees will simply fail since the protocol is set to be deployed to mainnet.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
change the address to mainnet like so
```diff
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
-        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023);
+        IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004);
    /// @notice    Address of the USDB contract on Blast
    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
-        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022);
+        IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003);

```
