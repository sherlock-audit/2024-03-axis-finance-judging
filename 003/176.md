# Incorrect address for blast weth and usdb

## Summary
Incorrect address for blast weth and usdb

## Vulnerability Detail

The addresses used for WETH and USDB in blast is incorrect. Currently the values of testnet is used instead of the mainnet

```solidity
contract BlastAuctionHouse is AuctionHouse {
    
    ...

    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _WETH =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023);

    IERC20Rebasing internal constant _USDB =
        IERC20Rebasing(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022);
```

The actual [addresses](https://docs.blast.io/building/contracts#l2-contract-addresses) on mainnet are:

```solidity
  IERC20Rebasing public constant USDB = IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000003);
  IERC20Rebasing public constant WETH = IERC20Rebasing(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000004);
```

## Impact

The deployment will itself revert and usage of this addresses in any other way will result in lost rewards
