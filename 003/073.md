# WETH address is incorrect, causing loss of WETH yield

## Summary
WETH address used is incorrect. `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023` is the address for testnet, not mainnet. As a result, the blast auction house cannot actually claim any WETH yield.

## Vulnerability Detail
The correct WETH address for mainnet should be `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000004`. Use of correct address is paramount, or all yield will be lost.

## Impact
Loss of yield with 100% certainty.
