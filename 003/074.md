# USDB address is incorrect, causing loss of USDB yield

## Summary
USDB address used is incorrect. `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022` is the address for testnet, not mainnet. As a result, the blast auction house cannot actually claim any USDB yield.

## Vulnerability Detail
The correct USDB address for mainnet should be `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000003`. Use of correct address is paramount, or all yield for USDB will be lost.

## Impact
Loss of yield with 100% certainty.
