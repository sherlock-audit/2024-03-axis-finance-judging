# Reckless check within createAuction may allow callback functionality to create auction using tokens from a (non-owned) callback address

## Summary

Reckless check within createAuction may allow callback functionality to create auction using tokens from a callback address


## Vulnerability Detail

Contract: Auctioneer.sol

First of all, we need to explain the rationale behind flags and the address. Trivially explained, the callback address is nothing else than an address with immutable arguments in the address itself. This means, the address determines which hooks are invoked. This logic is derived from Uniswap and can be found here: 

https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/hook-deployment

Within the auction function, it is possible to provide a callback address, which can have the SEND_BASE_TOKENS_FLAG set to true. If the auction is now a prefunded auction, the _onCreateCallback function is invoked:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L263C1-L264C71](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L263C1-L264C71)

which now executes a callback to the callback address:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L375](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L375)

This will then transfer the desired token in (the callback usually has tokens approved because it is used for exactly this purpose).

That way, it might be possible for a user to input an arbitrary callback address that has approved tokens to the AuctionHouse module and create the auction in his own name(address).

Afterwards, one must acknowledge that an order cancellation will result in sending the tokens back to the callback address:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L391](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L391)

However, the user might create the auction with a dummy token such that he can purchase the valuable base token (which has been drained from the callback address) with his own dummy token, effectively receiving the whole approved amount of dummy tokens in the callback address.

   —------------—------------—------------—------------

Now due to the msg.sender parameter in the callback:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L378](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/main/moonraker/src/bases/Auctioneer.sol#L378)

I acknowledge that it can be argued that this issue is not solely based on the protocol itself but also requires a lack of validation on the third-party side. 

However, given the recurring and ongoing approval exploits (Seneca, Prisma, etc), this edge-case must not remain unconsidered and a more strict check should be executed. 

Therefore, I am of the opinion that this issue can be classified as medium severity.

## Impact

IMPACT: 

a) Stolen funds due to approval abuse

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider executing an explicit check that callback.owner() == msg.sender, otherwise users might fall victims to such an attack.

I am of the strong opinion that the current “loose check” will result sooner or later in an exploit.
