# routing.funding overflow after AuctionHouse.curate function

## Summary
`Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?`
Any that implement ERC20 Metadata, have between 6 and 18 decimals, and do not have a fee-on-transfer functionality.
Since the protocol will interact with any ERC20 token, there is a risk of overflow after calling the `AuctionHouse.curate` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider the following case:
`prerequisite`: assume the base token has 18 decimals and costs a very low price.

1)Seller calls `token.approve(AuctionHouse, type(uint256).max)`;
2)Seller creates an `FPAM` auction with prefunded base tokens with a `type(96).max` amount of tokens and sets curator
3)Curator calls `setCuratorFee` with a `curatorFee` value and calls the `curate` function in which an overflow occurs:
```solidity
function curate(
        uint96 lotId_,
        bytes calldata callbackData_
    ) external nonReentrant {
        //code      

        // Calculate the fee amount based on the remaining capacity (must be in base token if auction is pre-funded)
        uint96 curatorFeePayout = uint96(
            _calculatePayoutFees(
                feeData.curated,
                feeData.curatorFee,
                module.remainingCapacity(lotId_)
            )
        );

        // If the auction is pre-funded (required for batch auctions), transfer the fee amount from the seller
        if (routing.funding > 0) {
            // Increment the funding
            // Cannot overflow, as capacity is bounded by uint96 and the curator fee has a maximum percentage
            unchecked {
-->             routing.funding += curatorFeePayout;
            }
    }
```
After this, the balance of AuctionHouse will be `type(96).max + curatorFee` tokens, and `routing.funding` will be approximately `curatorFee - 1` value.

## Impact
`routing.funding` will store an incorrect value, leading to loss of tokens when canceling an auction lot.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider not allowing the amount of prefunded base tokens to be `type(96).max` when creating an auction, and ensure that the sum of `capacity` and `curatorFee` does not exceed the `type(96).max` value.
