# `BlastGas` does not set gas fees to claimable resulting in a loss of revenue for the protocol.

## Summary
Existing L2s like Optimism and Arbitrum keep sequencer fees for themselves. Blast redirects sequencer fees to the dapps that induced them, allowing smart contract developers to have an additional source of revenue. In order to claim gas fees, a contract must set its gas mode to `Claimable`. `BlastGas` contract fails to do so, resulting in a loss of revenue for the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
`BlastGas` contract will be inherited by modules deployed on the Blast blockchain. The constructor of the `BlastGas` sets the governor to be AuctionHouse via a call to `configureGovernor()`. 

[BlastGas.sol#L11-L14](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/blast/modules/BlastGas.sol#L11-L14)
```solidity
constructor(address parent_) {
    IBlast(0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000002).configureGovernor(
        parent_
    );
}
```
Contracts on Blast have two options for their gas mode:
* **Void (DEFAULT)**: base + priority fees go to the sequencer operator
* **Claimable**: base + priority fees spent on this contract can be claimed by the contract, net of L1 fees

In order to change the gas mode to claimable and receive fees, a contract or a governor of that contract must call `BLAST.configureClaimableGas()`, which will change the gas mode to `Claimable`. Because this function is not called during contract creation nor it can be called by an AuctionHouse, all of the fees will go to the sequencer instead of the the protocol, when someone will try to claim gas consumed by a module.

```solidity
function claimModuleGas(Veecode reference_) external {
    // Claim the gas consumed by the module, send to protocol
    _BLAST.claimMaxGas(
        address(_getModuleIfInstalled(reference_)),
        _protocol
    );
}
```
## Impact
Loss of revenue for the protocol.

## Recommendation
Set the gas mode to `Claimable` in constructor of the the `BlastGas` the same way it is done in the [constructor of the BlastAuctionHouse](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-axis-finance/blob/cadf331f12b485bac184111cdc9ba1344d9fbf01/moonraker/src/blast/BlastAuctionHouse.sol#L58)
