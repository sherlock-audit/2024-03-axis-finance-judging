# USDB and WETH yield will be lost in the LinearVesting contract

## Summary
As the README states, `In the case of Blast's USDB and WETH (which rebase), the contract owner accrues the rebases for tokens sitting in the contract.` However, this is not the case for `LinearVesting` contract. If this derivative module is implemented in the auction, the payout would be transferred to the `LinearVesting` and locked there for the vesting period. In case if the payout tokens are USDB or WETH, this means that any yield from them will be lost since `LinearVesting` doesn't implement any functionality to retrieve the accrued yield. As per [blast developer documentation](https://docs.blast.io/building/guides/weth-yield), `Similar to ETH, WETH and USDB on Blast is also rebasing and follows the same yield mode configurations`, `Â WETH and USDB accounts have Automatic yield by default for both EOAs and smart contracts` and `On mainnet, ETH balances will update approximately daily.` We can safely assume that balances for WETH and USDB are also updated daily. This effectively means that if vesting period is more than a day, then the `LinearVesting` will start to automatically generate yield which will be lost there.

## Recommendation
For Blast mainnet, create additional `LinearVesting` contract similar to `BlastAuctionHouse` contract and apply the yield configuration there.
