# All base and quote tokens are stuck due to a blacklisted pfBidder in the EMPAM

## Summary
During the call of the `settle` function If there is a partial fill, sends the refund and payout to the bidder which can be critical if the bidder is in the blacklist address of the token at the time of the `settle` call.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider the following scenario:
1) Suppose an `EMPAM` is created with `baseToken - any token` and `quoteToken - USDT` with an auction length of 10 days.
2) Buyers bid on a lot with USDT.
3) 10 days pass, and the auction has concluded, at which point one of the buyers is blacklisted in USDT.
4) After submitting the private key and sorting and decrypting bids, the `settle` function is called, which handles the payout + refund to the partially filled bid.
If the blacklisted bidder is a partially filled bidder, the `settle` function will fail when transferring the refund USDT.
```solidity
// Send refund and payout to the bidder
                Transfer.transfer(
                    routing.quoteToken,
-->                 settlement.pfBidder,
                    settlement.pfRefund,
                    false
                );
                _sendPayout(
                    settlement.pfBidder,
                    settlement.pfPayout,
                    routing,
                    auctionOutput
                );
```

It's worth noting that if the `baseToken` is potentially `USDT`, a blacklisted partially filled bidder or curator could block all baseTokens and quoteTokens on `AuctionHouse.sol`.
```solidity
               _sendPayout(
                    settlement.pfBidder,
                    settlement.pfPayout,
                    routing,
                    auctionOutput
                );
                
               _sendPayout(
                    feeData.curator,
                    curatorFeePayout,
                    routing,
                    auctionOutput
                );
```

## Impact
All base and quote tokens are stuck due to a blacklisted partially filled bidder or curator
