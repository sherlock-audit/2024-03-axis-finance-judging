# All funds for the current lot will be frozen if seller does not give the private key

## Summary
In order for an auction to be settled it has to be decrypted. However, the decryption is highly relying on the seller to supply private key. If the seller does not supply it, claim functions will not work for batch auctions, leaving funds stuck in the lot.
## Vulnerability Detail
The decrypt function requires seller private key:

and here as well:

Imagine the lot is concluded but the seller does not submit the private key. In this case:
1)The claim bids function requires the lot to be settled. However in order for the lot to be settled, bids should be decrypted, which requires seller to submit private key. So it will not be available.
2)The refund function will not be available as the lot will be concluded.
## Impact
Users' funds will be stuck in the current lot. However the sellers provided funds will also be stuck so I believe in this case Medium severity will be most appropriate.

## Recommendation
The best mitigation would be to enable refunding until the key is submitted
