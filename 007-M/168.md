# Malicious seller can freeze quote tokens in EMPAM

## Summary
If the seller wishes to limit who can call, they can simply not reveal the key to anyone else.
This can lead to the conclusion that the seller can easily block the auction, causing buyers to lose their tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider the following scenario:

1)The seller successfully creates an `EMPAM` with their custom token as the base token and `USDT` as the quote token. Buyers place bids, and the auction concludes.
2)The seller does not submit their private key, thereby blocking USDT on `AuctionHouse.sol`:
```solidity
function submitPrivateKey(uint96 lotId_, uint256 privateKey_, uint64 num_) external
```
On the other hand, their custom token is also locked in the smart contract.
The issue arises from the fact that the value of the seller's custom token may not be equal to that of USDT, resulting in potentially smaller losses for the seller compared to the buyers.
For example, the `AuctionHouse` could serve as a presale platform for custom tokens.

## Recommendation
Allowing the call to `refundBid` until the private key is submitted could be a way to mitigate the issue.
